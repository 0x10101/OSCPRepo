</span></span>As we can see, the client starts with a suggestion of security protocols to use for the RDP session. Wedifferentiate these three protocols:<br/>
– Standard RDP security<br/>
– Enhanced RDP security or TLS security<br/>
– CredSSP<br/>
<br/>
Note that standard RDP security is alwayspossible and does not need to be advertised by the client. TLS, or “enhanced RDP security”, is simply standardRDP security wrapped inside an encrypted TLS tunnel<br/>
<br/>
An SSL handshake is performed after client and server have agreed on using enhanced RDP security, so if we want to MitM an RDP connection, we cannot simply use an SSL proxy, because the proxy needs to be aware of the RDP. It needs to recognize when to initiate the SSL handshake, similarly to StartTLS in SMTP or FTP.<br/>
