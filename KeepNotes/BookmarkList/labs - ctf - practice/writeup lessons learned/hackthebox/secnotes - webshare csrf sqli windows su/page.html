<title>SecNotes - Webshare CSRF SQLi</title>
</head><body>Keeping this general until the machine is retired:<br/>
<br/>
Make sure your webtools are performing as they need to be. Ie: following redirections or submitting requests properly<br/>
<br/>
Always audit all instances of special characters being passed and allowed. Even if something doesn't immediately look vulnerable, user data may be used later in multiple places. <br/>
<br/>
This also applies to data being truncated. ie if half of your data is gone, but trailing special characters remain. Did it get executed? Filtered? Improper quote terminations?<br/>
<br/>
Enumeration is sometimes as simple as "what is not default". If something sticks out, run with it. <br/>
<br/>
I ended up doing it the 'unintended' way through double sqli. There were hints to the 'nightmare' box on HTB and using SQLi payloads to create accounts eventually results in dumping all of the notes. After some parsing, you can see the login information left in the new-site note. <br/>
<br/>
Ippsec walkthrough below:<br/>
Browse to register.php, create an account. <br/>
Enumerate users through error based enum.<br/>
<br/>
Login and play around. Notice tyler@secnotes<br/>
New notes don't filter HTML tags at all. Test with &lt;center&gt;ippsec&lt;/center&gt;<br/>
Notice the change_pass.php doesn't have a CSRF token nor does it ask for confirmation of the old password.<br/>
Attack path: force someone else to update their password unknowningly<br/>
<br/>
Send a note to tyler directing him to your webserver<br/>
&lt;html&gt;<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;iframe src="http://10.10.10.97/change_pass.php?password=PleaseSubscribe&amp;confirm_password=PleaseSubscribe&amp;submit=submit"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br/>
&lt;/html&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the powershell agent is not accepting iframes? Maybe another way. Try another iframe and confirm iframes and powershell don't like each other. <br/>
<br/>
Just force him submitting a note with: http://10.10.10.97/change_pass.php?password=PleaseSubscribe&amp;confirm_password=PleaseSubscribe&amp;submit=submit<br/>
<br/>
Login and see all of the notes. new site note has a username and password being used in what looks like a windows share<br/>
smbmap -u tyler -p '' -H 10.10.10.97<br/>
<br/>
and see new-site with READ, WRITE access<br/>
so upload a webshell. This is the IIS website on 8808. <br/>
<br/>
PrivEsc:<br/>
This was a bit tricky, but notice that there is a ton of Windows Subsystem for Linux stuff. bash.lnk for example. <br/>
<br/>
Another way to identify this is to check: appdata\local\packages and look for:<br/>
CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu18 etc etc etc<br/>
and this is where you can browse the entire Linux filesystem in cmd/powershell<br/>
<br/>
Just type:<br/>
bash<br/>
<br/>
and get into a bash prompt as root. <br/>
check out the /root/.bash_history and woops! administrator password!<br/>
