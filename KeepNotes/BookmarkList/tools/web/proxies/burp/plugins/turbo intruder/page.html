<br/>
Turbo Intruder is a Burp Suite extension for sending large numbers of HTTP requests and analyzing the results. It's intended to complement Burp Intruder by handling attacks that require exceptional speed, duration, or complexity. The following features set it apart:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fast - Turbo Intruder uses a HTTP stack hand-coded from scratch with speed in mind. As a result, on many targets it can seriously outpace even fashionable asynchronous Go scripts.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Scalable - Turbo Intruder can achieve flat memory usage, enabling reliable multi-day attacks. It can also be run in headless environments via the command line.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Flexible - Attacks are configured using Python. This enables handling of complex requirements such as signed requests and multi-step attack sequences. Also, the custom HTTP stack means it can handle malformed requests that break other libraries.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Convenient - Boring results can be automatically filtered out by an advanced diffing algorithm adapted from Backslash Powered Scanner. This means you can launch an attack and obtain useful results in two clicks.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand it's undeniably harder to use, and the network stack isn't as reliable and battle-tested as core Burp's. Finally, I should mention that it's designed for sending lots of requests to a single host. If you want to send a single request to a lot of hosts, I recommend ZGrab.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Getting started</b><br/>
Install Turbo Intruder into Burp Suite using the BApp Store under the Extender tab.<br/>
<br/>
To use it, simply highlight the area you want to inject over, then right click and 'Send to Turbo Intruder':<br/>
<br/>
This will open a window containing your request and a Python snippet looking something like this:<br/>
<br/>
You can customise this code depending on what you want to achieve with your attack.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Basic use</b><br/>
You'll notice that the area of the request that you highlighted has been replaced with '%s' - this is where your payloads will be placed. To begin with you'll probably just want to change '/usr/share/dict/words' to a more suitable wordlist. Other than that the default script should work out of the box for simple use cases.<br/>
<br/>
<b>A word of caution</b><br/>
<br/>
Turbo Intruder achieves speed through network-level efficiency so it should remain relatively performant even on poor network connections; my first live demo was done in a pub basement using wifi borrowed from the coffee shop next door, and still achieved a few hundred requests per second.<br/>
<br/>
This means that the target website will probably be the limiting factor for how fast it can run. As it uses low numbers of concurrent connections it should be unlikely to cause the classic DoS situation where a server's connection pool is consumed and nobody else can connect. However targeting a resource intensive page may make the server struggle and slow down for everyone, so monitoring application performance during attacks is advised.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Filtering boring results</b><br/>
In Turbo Intruder, responses don't get placed in the results table automatically. Instead, the 'handleResponse' function is called, in which you can decide whether to add the response to the table. Here's a simple example:<br/>
<br/>
def handleResponse(req, interesting):<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; if '200 OK' in req.response:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; table.add(req)<br/>
<br/>
Coding a custom response check here isn't always necessary - if you queue a few requests with the 'learn' parameter then Turbo Intruder will learn those responses as boring, and then set the 'interesting' argument based on whether each new response looks like a boring one. This strategy is used by the default script. For further information on this filtering strategy, check out my presentation on Backslash Powered Scanner.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Speed tuning</b><br/>
If speed is important for your attack, you'll want to tune the pipeline, requestsPerConnection, and concurrentConnections arguments, probably in that order. Your goal should be to find values that maximise the RPS (Requests Per Second) value, while keep the Retries counter close to 0. The optimum values here are highly server dependent, but the max speed I've achieved to a remote server so far is 30,000 RPS. You may be able to achieve a further speed gain by slimming your request down, and/or shortening the response by changing the method from GET to HEAD.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Finding race conditions</b><br/>
The default script uses a streaming attack style, which is great for minimising memory usage but not ideal for finding race conditions. To find a race condition you'll want to ensure all your requests hit the target in as small a window as possible, which can be done by queueing all your requests before starting the request engine. You can find an example at race.py.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Built-in wordlists</b><br/>
Turbo Intruder has two built-in wordlists - one for launching long-running bruteforce attacks, and one containing all words observed in in-scope proxy traffic. The latter wordlist can lead to some quite interesting findings that would normally require manual testing to identify. You can see how to use these in specialWordlists.py.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Command line usage</b><br/>
From time to time, you might find you want to run Turbo Intruder from a server. To support headless use it can be launched directly from the jar, without Burp. You can grab a prebuilt turbo.jar from releases.<br/>
<br/>
You'll probably find it easiest to develop your script inside Burp as usual, then save and launch it on the server:<br/>
<br/>
java -jar turbo.jar &lt;scriptFile&gt; &lt;baseRequestFile&gt; &lt;endpoint&gt; &lt;baseInput&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Example:java -jar turbo.jar resources/examples/basic.py resources/examples/request.txt https://example.net:443 foo<br/>
<br/>
The command line support is pretty basic - if you try to use this exclusively you'll probably have a bad time. Also, it doesn't support automatic interesting response detection as this relies on various Burp methods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Swapping request engines</b><br/>
<br/>
Turbo Intruder has been architected to let you easily swap between different network stacks, using the optional 'engine' argument to RequestEngine. By default it'll use the speedy Engine.THREADED options, but in some situations you may prefer to take advantage of Burp's stability or upstream proxy handling by using Engine.BURP instead. Earlier versions of Turbo Intruder also had asynchronous and HTTP2 engines built on Apache HttpComponents but they were vastly less reliable than the threaded engine and didn't actually go any faster on most machines, so I canned them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Debugging problems</b><br/>
<br/>
If the 'failed' counter in the stats panel starts rapidly increasing, that's a good sign that something is amiss. It could be a problem with your script, the target website, or Turbo Intruder's network stack. If you're interested in helping make the tool better, I've made a debug script to help you identify and potentially report the source of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Final note</b><br/>
<br/>
As ever, I've got many plans for future improvements to Turbo Intruder. We also look forward to eventually introducing some features from Turbo Intruder's network stack into core Burp Suite tools. Also, while I have your attention, we're currently collecting votes for the top 10 web hacking techniques of 2018, and we'd love to have yours.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, have fun, and try not to take anything down.</body></html>
