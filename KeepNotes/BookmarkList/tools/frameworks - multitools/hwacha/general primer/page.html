The most simple task it can be used for is testing credentials against targets. If we have a valid username and password, we can test it against a range of IPs.<br/>
<br/>
Collect data such as -m keys, or -m history<br/>

<br/>
Once we find a private key, it will be stored in a “loot” folder on the system running Hwacha. &nbsp;We can also use this key to authenticate instead of using a password, and we can also use the “-x” flag to run a command on the system.<br/>
<br/>
We can also use Hwacha to execute a Meterpreter stager. &nbsp;by default, it will chose a python payload.<br/>
While a python Meterpreter shell is nice, an x64 or x86 Meterpreter shell is better. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;More functionality. &nbsp;With a native payload you can access the webcam and perform lower level functionality that isn’t possible with the python or PHP payloads.<br/>
<br/>
It is also very important to note that this payload does not touch disk! &nbsp;Python is used to execute native shellcode in memory. &nbsp;This greatly reduces our chances of being detected.<br/>
<br/>
While I’m a pretty big fan of Metasploit, it is not the only Remote Access/Administration Tool (RAT) on the market. &nbsp;In fact, Pupy is an extremely versatile cross-platform RAT written in python. One way to deploy a Pupy agent is by using the web delivery module in Hwacha. &nbsp;We can direct it to any python file and Hwacha will execute it on the target all within memory. Once you have the python file, use the web_delivery module with Hwacha and supply options for the path and a port for the web server. The target will pull down the file and execute it in memory.<br/>
<br/>
Another cool module you can use (which is also in CME) is mimipenguin. &nbsp;If you have root, you can scrape memory and dump plaintext passwords. &nbsp;This is particularly useful if the target system is running GNOME. &nbsp;This module works much like the web delivery module, though you don’t need to supply the path to the script. By default this will wait up to 5 minutes to receive results. &nbsp;The time to complete will vary depending on the system resources.<br/>
<br/>
Hwacha also includes modules for MacOS. &nbsp;Much like Linux, you can easily execute python and PHP Meterpreter shells on MacOS. &nbsp;It can also use a native payload as well. &nbsp;At the time of writing, no staged payload exists in Metasploit so to get an x64 Meterpreter shell so Hwacha will copy over a Macho binary and execute it on the target, and remove the payload after. &nbsp;While this is not as good as the diskless shellcode method, it does make the process simple.<br/>
<br/>
Executing Binaries with sudo (Bella RAT)<br/>
While both Meterpreter and Pupy are both great RATs, on MacOS you also have the option of using Bella, which is an extremely powerful RAT for MacOS. &nbsp;We can use the privs module to check if we have sudo permissions on the target system. &nbsp;If we do, we can use the sudo_exec module which will copy a file over and execute it with sudo. &nbsp;Because Bella becomes most useful once root permissions are obtained, this is ideal.<br/>
After Sending the payload we should see the incoming connection on our Bella Control Center.<br/>
<br/>
The functionality within Bella is nothing short of horrifying for the target, as Bella boasts the ability to download almost all sensitive data from the synced iCloud account. &nbsp;Here is a list of modules available in Bella:<br/>
