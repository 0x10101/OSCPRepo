<title>Authentication Best Practices</title>
</head><body><b>Introduction</b><br/>
<b>Authentication</b>&nbsp;is the process of verification that an individual, entity or website is who it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a user name or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Session Management</b>&nbsp;is a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it. This is required for a server to remember how to react to subsequent requests throughout a transaction. Sessions are maintained on the server by a session identifier which can be passed back and forward between the client and server when transmitting and receiving requests. Sessions should be unique per user and computationally very difficult to predict.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Authentication General Guidelines</b><br/>
<b>User IDs</b><br/>
Make sure your usernames/userids are case insensitive. User 'smith' and user 'Smith' should be the same user. User names should also be unique. For high security applications usernames could be assigned and secret instead of user-defined public data.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Email address as a User ID</b><br/>
For information on validating email addresses, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.md#Email_Address_Validation">input validation cheatsheet email discussion</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Authentication Solution and Sensitive Accounts</b><ul><li style="list-style-type: none">Do <b>NOT</b>&nbsp;allow login with sensitive accounts (i.e. accounts that can be used internally within the solution such as to a back-end / middle-ware / DB) to any front end user interface</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">Do <b>NOT</b>&nbsp;use the same authentication solution (e.g. IDP / AD) used internally for unsecured access (e.g. public access / DMZ)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Require Re-authentication for Sensitive Features</b><br/>
In order to mitigate CSRF and session hijacking, it's important to require the current credentials for an account before updating sensitive account information such as the user's password, user's email, or before sensitive transactions, such as shipping a purchase to a new address. Without this countermeasure, an attacker may be able to execute sensitive transactions through a CSRF or XSS attack without needing to know the user's current credentials. Additionally, an attacker may get temporary physical access to a user's browser or steal their session ID to take over the user's session.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Consider Strong Transaction Authentication</b><br/>
Some applications should use a second factor to check whether a user may perform sensitive operations. For more information see the <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Transaction_Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.md">Transaction Authorization Cheat Sheet</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>TLS Client Authentication</b><br/>
TLS Client Authentication, also known as two-way TLS authentication, consists of both, browser and server, sending their respective TLS certificates during the TLS handshake process. Just as you can validate the authenticity of a server by using the certificate and asking a well known Certificate Authority (CA) if the certificate is valid, the server can authenticate the user by receiving a certificate from the client and validating against a third party CA or its own CA. To do this, the server must provide the user with a certificate generated specifically for him, assigning values to the subject so that these can be used to determine what user the certificate should validate. The user installs the certificate on a browser and now uses it for the website.<br/>
<br/>
It is a good idea to do this when:<br/>
<br/>
It is acceptable (or even preferred) that the user only has access to the website from only a single computer/browser.<br/>
The user is not easily scared by the process of installing TLS certificates on his browser or there will be someone, probably from IT support, that will do this for the user.<br/>
The website requires an extra step of security.<br/>
It is also a good thing to use when the website is for an intranet of a company or organization.<br/>
<br/>
It is generally not a good idea to use this method for widely and publicly available websites that will have an average user. For example, it wouldn't be a good idea to implement this for a website like Facebook. While this technique can prevent the user from having to type a password (thus protecting against an average keylogger from stealing it), it is still considered a good idea to consider using both a password and TLS client authentication combined.<br/>

<br/>
<b>Authentication and Error Messages</b><br/>
Incorrectly implemented error messages in the case of authentication functionality can be used for the purposes of user ID and password enumeration. An application should respond (both HTTP and HTML) in a generic manner.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Authentication Responses</b><br/>
An application should respond with a generic error message regardless of whether the user ID or password was incorrect. It should also give no indication to the status of an existing account.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Incorrect Response Examples</b><br/>
"Login for User foo: invalid password"<br/>
"Login failed, invalid user ID"<br/>
"Login failed; account disabled"<br/>
"Login failed; this user is not active"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Correct Response Example</b><br/>
"Login failed; Invalid userID or password"<br/>
<br/>
The correct response does not indicate if the user ID or password is the incorrect parameter and hence inferring a valid user ID.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Error Codes and URLs</b><br/>
The application may return a different HTTP Error code depending on the authentication attempt response. It may respond with a 200 for a positive result and a 403 for a negative result. Even though a generic error page is shown to a user, the HTTP response code may differ which can leak information about whether the account is valid or not.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Prevent Brute-Force Attacks</b><br/>
If an attacker is able to guess passwords without the account becoming disabled due to failed authentication attempts, the attacker has an opportunity to continue with a brute force attack until the account is compromised. Automating brute-force/password guessing attacks on web applications is a trivial challenge. Password lockout mechanisms should be employed that lock out an account if more than a preset number of unsuccessful login attempts are made. Password lockout mechanisms have a logical weakness. An attacker that undertakes a large number of authentication attempts on known account names can produce a result that locks out entire blocks of user accounts. Given that the intent of a password lockout system is to protect from brute-force attacks, a sensible strategy is to lockout accounts for a period of time (e.g., 20 minutes). This significantly slows down attackers, while allowing the accounts to reopen automatically for legitimate users.<br/>
<br/>
Also, multi-factor authentication is a very powerful deterrent when trying to prevent brute force attacks since the credentials are a moving target. When multi-factor is implemented and active, account lockout may no longer be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Logging and Monitoring</b><br/>
Enable logging and monitoring of authentication functions to detect attacks / failures on a real time basis<br/>
<br/>
Ensure that all failures are logged and reviewed<br/>
Ensure that all password failures are logged and reviewed<br/>
Ensure that all account lockouts are logged and reviewed</body></html>
