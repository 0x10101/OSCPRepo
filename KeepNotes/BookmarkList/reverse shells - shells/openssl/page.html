Cryptography<br/>
Before the listener can be started, a key pair and a certificate must be generated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>S_Client</b>, the likeness of nc and OpenSSL client functionality is immediate as the simple command: <br/>
openssl s_client -quiet -connect [ip]:[port] &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
is equivalent tonc [ip]:[port]. The -quiet flag is necessary as if not the session will be renegotiated if an R ever starts a line in the input.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>S_Server</b>, OpenSSL server functionality is a little bit different from nc's and it's somewhat more difficult to set up as it needs a valid public key certificate, fortunately OpenSSL "main function" is to generate the type of certificate we need. Generating one of these can be easily be done with this command: <br/>
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 30 -nodes <br/>
<br/>
this generates a private key into the file key.pem and it writes a cert into the cert.pem file these we can then use to set up the server. To set up the server we can then run openssl: <br/>
s_server -quiet -key [keyfile] -cert [cert] -port [port] <br/>
<br/>
this is equivalent to running nc -lp [ip] [port] as long as we provide a valid keyfile and it's associated public key certificate<br/>
<br/>
Knowing this we can easily understand how we can "abuse this" to generate reverse shells</body></html>
