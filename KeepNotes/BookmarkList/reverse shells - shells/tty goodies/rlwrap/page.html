<br/>
* WHAT IT IS: <br/>
<br/>
rlwrap is a 'readline wrapper', a small utility that uses the GNU<br/>
readline library to allow the editing of keyboard input for any<br/>
command. I couldn't find anything like it when I needed it, so I wrote<br/>
this one back in 1999. &nbsp;By now, there are (and, in hindsight, even<br/>
then there were) a number of good readline wrappers around, like rlfe,<br/>
distributed as part of the GNU readline library, and the amazing socat<br/>
(http://freecode.com/projects/socat). You should consider rlwrap <br/>
especially when you need user-defined completion (by way of completion word<br/>
lists) and persistent history, or if you want to program 'special<br/>
effects' using the filter mechanism. rlwrap compiles and runs on a <br/>
fairly wide range of Unix-like systems.<br/>
<br/>
* HOW TO USE IT:<br/>
If <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; $ &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt;<br/>
<br/>
doesn't let you use arrow keys to edit input, or if you just want<br/>
decent input history and completion, try:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; $ rlwrap [-options] &lt;command&gt; &lt;args&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You then can edit &lt;command&gt;'s input and recall the input history using<br/>
the arrow keys. &nbsp;Input history is remembered accross invocations,<br/>
separately for different &lt;command&gt;s. Typing !&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; will recall<br/>
the last input line starting with &lt;prefix&gt;, CTRL-R will search the<br/>
input history. &nbsp;With the -r and -f options you can specify the list of<br/>
words which rlwrap will use as possible completions, taking them from a <br/>
file (-f option) or from &lt;command&gt;'s standard in/output.<br/>
rlwrap monitors &lt;command&gt;'s terminal settings, so that it can do the<br/>
right thing when command asks for single keypresses or for a password.<br/>
Commands that already use readline will always ask for (and get)<br/>
single keypresses, which makes rlwrapping them rather<br/>
pointless. However, if one uses the -a option, rlwrap will use its own<br/>
line editing and history. Unforunately, in this case, rlwrap cannot<br/>
detect whether &lt;command&gt; asks for a password. This can be remedied by<br/>
giving the password prompt (excluding trailing space and possibly the<br/>
first few letters) as an argument to the -a option.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
* EXAMPLES:<br/>
Run netcat with command-line editing:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; rlwrap nc localhost 80<br/>
<br/>
Run lprolog and use library1 and library2 to build a completion word<br/>
list:<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; rlwrap -f library1 -f library2 lprolog<br/>
<br/>
Run smbclient (which already uses readline), add all input and output<br/>
to completion list, complete local filenames, avoid showing (and<br/>
storing) passwords:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; rlwrap -cr -aPassword: smbclient '\\PEANUT\C' <br/>
<br/>
* INSTALLATION:<br/>
Usually just<br/>
<br/>
# ./configure; make install<br/>
<br/>
See the INSTALL file for more information.<br/>
<br/>
* PARENTHESIS MATCHING <br/>
This can be controlled by putting "set blink-matching-paren (off|on)"<br/>
in your .inputrc. This setting is mentioned, but not clearly<br/>
documented in readline's info or manpages; it should be on by default.<br/>
<br/>
* FILTERS <br/>
Filters are "plug-in" scripts that give you complete control<br/>
over rlwrap's input and output, history and completion. They are <br/>
somewhat experimental, and their implementation and the example<br/>
filters still are of slightly dubious ('alpha') quality.<br/>
