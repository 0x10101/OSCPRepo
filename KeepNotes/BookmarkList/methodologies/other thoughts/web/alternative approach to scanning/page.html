<title>Alternative Approach to Scanning</title>
</head><body>Rather than scanning for vulnerabilities, we need to scan for <i>interesting behaviour</i>. This interesting behaviour can also be characters that the application cares about or gives special significance to. <br/>
<br/>
Then, having identified the tiny fraction of inputs that yield interesting behaviour, we can investigate further. This iterative approach to identifying vulnerabilities is both extremely flexible in what it can identify, and highly efficient. An input that doesn't yield any interesting results can be quickly discounted, saving time for sustained investigation of inputs that look more promising. The development of a scanner that uses this technique can also be approached in successive stages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Further research</b><br/>
The techniques and code used in the scanner can be adapted to detect far more than server-side injection vulnerabilities. We've already seen that followup probe pairs can be used to identify both WAFs and search functions.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Enumerable input detection</b><br/>
Applications frequently suffer from access control bypasses where attackers can perform unauthorised operations simply by incrementing a number, for example on a URL like /edit_profile?id=734<br/>
<br/>
We can automate detection of inputs where it's possible to obtain additional data by incrementing a number. First, confirm that id=734, id=735, and id=736 return distinct responses. Fetching three distinct responses shows that the id input is being used, and that we're getting more than an 'invalid id' message. However, the application might just be performing a fixed transformation on the input or using it to seed an RNG. By requesting id=100734 and id=100735, and confirming they match, we can verify that we're retrieving data from a finite set.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Cold-start bruteforce attacks</b><br/>
Pentesters are often in a situation where they want to bruteforce a value, but don't know what the success condition looks like. I made the earliest version of this scanner on a pentest where an ill-prepared client had failed to provide me with a single valid username, let alone a password. In order to stand a chance of guessing a valid password I had to bruteforce a username first, but the response to a valid username might be only subtly different, and I couldn't manually review thousands of login attempts. Using the response attribute diffing technique, this attack can be reliably automated. This approach can even bypass anti-bruteforce measures; when testing this tool I found that addons.mozilla.org gave a slightly distinct response to login attempts with a valid password, even when the account was locked due to excessive login attempts.<br/>
<br/>
Bruteforcing file and folder names on servers that don't provide helpful 404 codes raises a similar challenge. With a few modifications, we could also use this technique to bruteforce hidden parameters to find mass-assignment vulnerabilities, and perhaps even bruteforce valid objects for deserialization exploits.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Conclusion</b><br/>
Classic scanners have several serious blind spots when it comes to identifying server-side injection vulnerabilities. By modelling the approach of an experienced manual tester, I have created a scanner that avoids these blind spots and is extremely efficient. It currently classifies inputs as either boring, interesting, or vulnerable to a specific issue. Issues classified as interesting require manual investigation by security experts, so at present this tool is primarily useful only to security experts. However, the scanner can be adapted to classify individual issues, so over time the proportion of issues classified as 'interesting' instead of 'vulnerable' should drop, making it suitable for a broader range of users.</body></html>
