In an engagement the goal of discovery is to gain an understanding of the application from an <b>attackers perspective.</b><br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
Transitioning from Mapping to Discovery<br/>
It’s generally time to transition from mapping to discovery after you’ve established your sitemap, and conducted some initial functional analysis of the target. At this point you’re going to be looking to identify as many vulnerabilities in the target application as possible. This includes, not only, <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">The OWASP Top 10</a>&nbsp;but also flaws in application business logic. Bear in mind that you will encounter a myriad of vulnerabilities that do not fit nicely into one specific category so you should always be vigilant.<br/>
<br/>
Content Discovery<br/>
Vulnerability Scanning &nbsp;<br/>
Name Description &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
Nikto Web server vulnerability scanner with fantastic fingerprinting capabilities. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Nikto is among the best when it comes to vulnerability scanners and does an excellent job at identifying vulnerabilities in the target application. It also has a -Format switch to easily export the scan results into a format that is easy to read and refer to later on.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Scan the target &amp; output results into HTML format for easier readability.</b><br/>
nikto -h http://example.com -output ~/nikto.html -Format htm &nbsp; Vulnerability scanning with Nikto will typically mark the transition from mapping to discovery. <br/>
<br/>
Once you have the results of your scan it's important to take the time to review them and visit any page/s that stand out<br/>
<br/>
Forced Browsing<br/>
Name Description &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
Burp Engagement Tools A set of special purpose tools built into Burp Suite Pro that apply to specific resources &nbsp; <br/>
Engagement Tool: Discover Content Forced borwsing tool built into Burp Suite Pro &nbsp; <br/>
Burp Intruder Burp suite tool used to automate customized attacks against web applications (e.g. brute forcing, injection, etc.) &nbsp; <br/>
FuzzDB Open source database of malicious inputs, predictable resource names, greppable strings for server response messages, and other resources like web shells &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Forced browsing is a discovery technique for identifying resources that are not referenced by the target application, but are reachable nonetheless. Discover Content is a Burp tool that exists specifically for this purpose. Additionally, Burp Intruder can also be used for forced browsing by conducting a dictionary attack against the target (usually by injecting into url parameters or file paths). FuzzDB contains some excellent wordlists for this purpose, specifically take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb/tree/master/discovery">discovery</a>&nbsp;section for wordlists for the purpose of forced browsing.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Testing for Alternative Content &nbsp; <br/>
Name Description &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
User Agent Switcher Firefox addon that allows for quickly changing the browser's user agent string &nbsp; <br/>
Burp Intruder Burp suite tool used to automate customized attacks against web applications (e.g. brute forcing, injection, etc.) &nbsp; <br/>
FuzzDB Open source database of malicious inputs, predictable resource names, greppable strings for server response messages, and other resources like web shells &nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
One thing I really like to do early on during the discovery process is to try different user agents on certain pages using the User Agent Switcher extension for Firefox. This extension does exactly what it sounds like and changes the User-Agent request header to the one you select in the extension. This is because some applications are written to respond differently to different User-Agent and Referer headers.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
I’ll often use Burp Intruder to fuzz the User-Agent and Referer headers for some of these pages as well. Typically using a wordlist from the FuzzDB project as well.<br/>
<br/>
Automated Discovery<br/>
Name Description &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
Burp Scanner Burp Suite tool used for automatically finding security vulnerabilities in web applications. &nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
While you’ve been mapping the application and conducting the initial parts of discovery Burp Passive Scanner has been running in the background analyzing the target for vulnerabilities. These scan results should be reviewed prior to kicking off a scan with Burp Active Scanner with any particularly stand-out pages made note of so that you can investigate them further at a later time.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Due to the <b>very</b>&nbsp;long amount of time that it takes for Burp Active Scanner to complete I usually prefer to run it in bursts, reviewing scan results in between and making note of the results.<br/>
<br/>
Automated Scanning is dangerous <br/>
Using Burp Scanner may result in unexpected effects in some applications. Until you are fully familiar with its functionality and settings, you should only use Burp Scanner against non-production systems.<br/>
<br/>
Configuration <br/>
Default Configurations<br/>
Testing for default configurations is a logical follow-up step after enumerating the different technologies in-use by the target during mapping. A lot of frameworks ship with vulnerable pre-configured applications in order to introduce developers to their offerings. However, a lot of these “sample applications” are vulnerable out of the box! Better still if they exist on the same web server as the target (usually due to developer negligence, and forgotten about) they can oftentimes expose it to attack.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Testing for Misconfigurations <br/>
Ideally you should be keeping an eye out for misconfigurations in the application at all stages of testing. But, some big things you want to look out for at this point are verbose error messages since they will oftentimes give away useful information about <b>database structure</b>&nbsp;and the <b>web server file system</b>.<br/>
<br/>
Verbose Error Messages Are Almost Always a Finding <br/>
The knowledge that these error messages give to attackers can often help in exploiting successful injection or LFI (local file include) attacks.<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
Another thing to look out for is any sensitive form fields that do not explicitly disable autofill. A big one that I see quite a bit is password fields with a “show/hide” button. By default browsers do not save the values entered for input tags with a type="password" attribute. However, when the “show” button is pressed it changes the input to type="text" which the browser can put in it’s autofill cache. This is a risk if the application can ever be used in a shared computing environment.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Authentication<br/>
During the discovery process you should scrutinize any login forms that you come across. If these forms are not properly secured (e.g. 2-factor, captcha, retry attempt lockout, etc.) an attacker can often gain unauthorized access to user account/s. Depending on how these forms are written or what framework / CMS is being used the target application may reveal the existence of a user account even if a login attempt fails.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
If any of these are true in your test it should almost always be noted and reported as a finding. Further, if any of the login forms are not using encryption (or an outdated/broken version of SSL/TLS) that should be noted and reported as well.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Fuzzing Logins<br/>
Name Description &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
CeWL Wordlist generator that creates wordlists by spidering target web sites &nbsp; <br/>
Burp Intruder Burp suite tool used to automate customized attacks against web applications (e.g. brute forcing, injection, etc.) &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
After you’ve scrutinized the applications login form/s it’s usually a good time to do some fuzzing. CeWL is a really great tool for building custom wordlists for just this purpose. You should review the help documentation first by using the -h switch.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
For reference the syntax you will use will always be something like<br/>
&nbsp;cewl [options] www.example.com &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Once you’ve crafted your custom wordlist it’s time to break out Burp Intruder once again and do the actual fuzzing. Generally I do this using two-payload sets (one being a wordlist of usernames and the other my CeWL generated list for the passwords). The attack type you should typically use in intruder for this type of fuzzing is Cluster Bomb.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Session Management<br/>
Session-token / Cookie analysis is not a particularly glamorous part of any engagement but it’s an important one nonetheless. Typically you want to try and get an understanding of what the target application is using for session tracking and then test the session-tokens themselves using a tool like Burp Sequencer in order to determine how random/predictable they are. Further, some applications (generally legacy apps) will store session contents on the client-side. Occasionally this data will contain encoded, serialized objects that could potentially hold sensitive information.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
This is also the time to check if the Set-Cookie header of the http responses from the web server contains Secure and HttpOnly flags. If not this should be noted and reported as a finding as there is never really a reason not to include these flags.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Ask Google <br/>
It only takes a minute to google search the particular session token that you have from the target. This could potentially lead to being able to predict session tokens, which opens the door to session hijacking attacks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Testing Session Tokens With Burp<br/>
Name Description &nbsp; &nbsp;Burp Sequencer Burp Suite tool for analyzing randomness in a collection of data. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Burp Sequencer is an excellent tool that allows us to test session-tokens for randomness and predictability. While you are testing session-management you should use this tool to analyze the session token by <b>clearing your cookies</b>&nbsp;and then authenticating into the target application. Send the HTTP response containing the Set-Cookie header to Burp Sequencer and then have the sequencer analyze the token by starting a live capture. Typically it’s okay stop the live capture after ~10,000 requests as that is generally sufficient to determine randomness and predictability in the session-tokens.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
If session tokens are not sufficiently random it opens the door to session hijacking attacks, and should be noted.<br/>
<br/>
Authorization <br/>
Authorization issues like <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A7-Missing_Function_Level_Access_Control">missing function level access control</a>, and <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References">insecure direct object reference</a>&nbsp;are among the most prevalent findings that I come across a majority of the time. This is because a lot of developers do not take into account the idea that a low-privilege user, or even an unauthenticated user, would try to send requests to higher-privilege endpoint (broken access control)<br/>
&nbsp;http://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo &nbsp;<br/>
or attempt to access data belonging to a different user (insecure direct objet reference)<br/>
&nbsp;http://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Testing Access Control<br/>
Name Description &nbsp; &nbsp;Compare Site Maps Burp Tool for testing authorization by comparing site maps &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
This is a technique that I like to use after I’ve acquired two different user accounts intended to have different access levels within the target application (usually a standard account and an admin account, but this also works for testing unauthenticated users as well).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
I will map the application using the higher-privilege account, logout of the application, login as the lower-privilege user, then use Burp’s Compare Site Maps tool in order to see what resources I can access as the lower-privilege user that should be limited to only the higher-privilege user.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Make sure your target is added to the default session-handing rule's scope! <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Data Validation Testing<br/>
Name Description &nbsp; &nbsp;Burp Repeater Simple tool for manually manipulating and reissuing individual HTTP requests &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Injection vulnerabilities exist in web applications because they accept arbitrary user input, and do not properly validate it on the server-side. As a tester you should make note of any areas of the application that accept arbitrary user input and try to inject into them.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
All applications are different so there is no one single blanket checklist you should follow when testing for injection flaws. However, I will try to break them down into sub-sections along with example injection payloads. Further, Burp Repeater is typically what I use the most when testing for injection flaws. It is a relatively-simple tool that lets you repeat requests to the same endpoint while giving you the opportunity to change the payload each time.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Something <b>very</b>&nbsp;important to keep in mind: The purpose of discovery is to simply identify the flaws, whereas with exploitation we want to see how far they go. Obviously, the existence of any of these injection flaws is worthy of reporting, however try to save in-depth testing of each one after the discovery phase.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Please refer to the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/">OWASP</a>&nbsp;links in each sub-section for more information.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
SQL Injection<br/>
If any inputs are used in queries to a database they could possibly be vulnerable to SQL injection. Combined with misconfiguration issues such as <b>verbose error messages</b>&nbsp;this can lead to significant amounts of data being compromised by an attacker.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
I recommend reading <a href="https://sqlwiki.netspi.com/#mysql">this wiki by Netspi</a>&nbsp;when testing for SQL injection as it’s a great resource. At it’s simplest though, if you get a database error back from any of these payloads odds are that the target is vulnerable to SQL injection.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Sqlmap is a tool that allows for testing for sql injection in an automated way, and I will dig into its use further in the <b>exploitation</b>&nbsp;section.<br/>

Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of JavaScript, to a different end user.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
There are 3 different types of XSS that you should keep an eye out for:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;<b>Stored</b>&nbsp;- A Stored XSS vulnerability exists when data provided to a web application by a user is first stored persistently on the server.</li>
<li>&nbsp;<b>Reflected</b>&nbsp;- A Reflected XSS vulnerability exists when data provided by a web client is used immediately by server-side scripts to generate a page of results for that user.</li>
<li>&nbsp;<b>DOM-Based</b>&nbsp;- A DOM-based XSS vulnerability exists within a page’s client-side script itself.</li>
</ul>

Discovering flaws in business logic requires you, as the attacker, to have a decent fundemental understanding of the target application. Once you know the way the application is intended to be used you can start to reason how it could be exploited. When testing for business logic flaws refer back to areas of the application where you as the user are expected to complete a series of actions in a certain order (e.g. password reset form, order form, etc.) and try executing those actions out of order.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Further, you should check if a user is able to enter unrealistic values into certain inputs fields within the application (e.g. a fitness app where a user is expected to enter the amount of miles run)?<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
This is also a good time to test for <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unrestricted_File_Upload">unrestricted file upload</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;Encryption Flaws<a href="https://jdow.io/blog/2018/03/18/web-application-penetration-testing-methodology/#encryption-flaws">Permalink</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;Name Description &nbsp; &nbsp;SSLyze TLS/SSL Implementation Analyzer &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
When determining the quality of an applications SSL/TLS implementation I always recommend starting out with the <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSL Labs’ Server Test</a>, and SSLyze if that can’t be done.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>SSLyze Example</b><br/>
&nbsp;sslyze --regular www.example.com &nbsp;<br/>
Generally, this boils down to:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>Whether or not the application is using some form of encryption.</li>
<li>Is that encryption protocol insecure or vulnerable (TLS 1.2, SSL2/SSl3)?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
You should also use this time to investigate if the application is using weak encryption algorithms (e.g. MD5, RC4, etc.) and supports forward secrecy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Denial-of-Service<br/>
In a nutshell Denial-of-Service (DoS) is an attack wherein the prepetrator aims to make the target application unavilable to its users in one way or another. Denial-of-Service attack vectors can range from user file uploads (if they are not logically restricted by size) to a user account lockout mechanism in place to prevent brute force login attempts.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
If there are any pages that take a long time to load or ajax requests that take a long time to come back, these could be indicators of poorly written SQL queries that could be leveraged to perform a DoS attack.<br/>

If the application that you’re testing makes use of flash or other compiled client-side technologies (e.g. silverlight) it’s worth it to download them to your filesystem and use a tool like JPEXS FFDec to decompile them and examine the source code. If you’re able to successfully reverse engineer the application you may uncover some flaws in the underlying code.<br/>
