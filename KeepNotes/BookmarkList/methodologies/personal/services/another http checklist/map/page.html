In an engagement the goal of mapping is to gain an understanding of the application from a typical users perspective.<br/>

Browser and Interception Proxy Setup <br/>
Firefox<br/>
Tool &#09;&#09;Description &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
Firefox &#09;Modern, cross-platform, web browser that boasts a large collection of useful extensions. <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
Firefox is typically the default choice in browser when it comes to web application penetration testing. This is namely because of the amount of useful extensions available, and the fact that it doesn’t affect your global proxy settings.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Firefox Extensions &nbsp; <br/>
Tool &#09;&#09;&#09;Description &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/?src=search">User Agent Switcher</a>&nbsp;Firefox addon that allows for quickly changing the browser's user agent string &nbsp; <br/>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/">Wappalyzer</a>&nbsp;&#09;Browser extension that detects various software components and technologies used on websites. &nbsp;<br/>
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/">FoxyProxy</a>&nbsp;&#09;Web browser proxy switcher &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
These are extensions that I generally use in one way or another in every engagement and I recommend installing them prior to mapping.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Configure Firefox for Burp<br/>
Before you can begin mapping the application you must first configure your browser to proxy traffic through Burp<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;In Firefox </li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>&nbsp;Configure the FoxyProxy extension with a proxy for Burp Suite </li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>&nbsp;IP: 127.0.0.1 </li>
<li>Port: 8080 </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Configure Firefox to trust Burp’s dynamic SSL certificates </li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>&nbsp;Open <a href="http://burp/">http://burp/</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Save the certificate</li>
<li>Import the certificate into Firefox </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Burp Configuration<br/>
Tool &#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;Description &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
Burp Suite Pro &#09;&#09;Integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
You should customize Burp so that it suites your preferences. But, at the very least I recommend setting the Scan Speed to thorough since you will typically be using the scanner sparingly and this way it will make more requests and check for more vulnerabilities when it is being used.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Burp Extensions<br/>
Tool &#09;&#09;&#09;Description &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
Burp Extender &#09;API for expanding the functionality of Burp suite, extensions available within the BApp store. &nbsp; <br/>
Retire.js (BApp) Burp suite extension used to detect vulnerabilities in outdated JavaScript components. &nbsp; <br/>
Wsdler (BApp) &#09;Burp suite extension that parses WSDL files to create sample requests for all available methods &nbsp; <br/>
Python Scripter (BApp) Executes a custom python script on each HTTP request and response by processed by Burp. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
These are the Burp extensions that I typically use in most engagements. Much like the Firefox extensions I like to have them installed prior to mapping the application.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
These are installed using the Burp Extender module within Burp Suite Pro.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Manual Mapping<br/>
Manual enumeration of the web application is perhaps the most important part of the mapping process. It’s imperative that you visit every page, follow every link, and perform every iteration with the application that you possibly can in order to establish a request/response baseline in Burp’s sitemap.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Manual mapping is critical for Single Page Apps <br/>
Automatic spidering often fails when it comes to mapping single page applications due to the fact that most HTTP requests are sent asynchronously via JavaScript (AJAX).<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Automated Mapping<br/>
Automated Mapping is done using Burp Spider and can be useful in finding additional pages that you normally wouldn’t find during manual enumeration. Typically Burp Spider will find more pages in legacy applications than in more-modern SPAs.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Automated Spidering is dangerous <br/>
Depending on the situation I will map anywhere from 80% to 95% of the target application manually and only use the spider in very specific situations. This is because the spider can potentially be destructive in certain situations<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Post-Mapping Analysis<br/>
At this point you should have the first iteration of the sitemap of the application you’re testing in Burp and you should make note of what you’ve identified thus far.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Specifics you should make note of:</b><br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Web server</li>
<li>Application Architecture (Tech Stack)</li>
<li>Programming Language/s</li>
<li>Frameworks</li>
<li>Design Patterns</li>
</ul>
<br/>
This is also a good time to make note of any areas of the application where you are expected to complete a series of actions in a certain order. Oftentimes these processes can be manipulated and executed out of order and can possibly lead to significant findings (e.g. e-commerce checkout experience, password reset form, etc.).<br/>
