ID&#09;Name&#09;Description<br/>
T1238&#09;Assign KITs, KIQs, and/or intelligence requirements&#09;Once generated, Key Intelligence Topics (KITs), Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs), and/or intelligence requirements are assigned to applicable agencies and/or personnel. For example, an adversary may decide nuclear energy requirements should be assigned to a specific organization based on their mission.<br/>
<br/>
T1239&#09;Receive KITs/KIQs and determine requirements&#09;Applicable agencies and/or personnel receive intelligence requirements and evaluate them to determine sub-requirements related to topics, questions, or requirements. For example, an adversary's nuclear energy requirements may be further divided into nuclear facilities versus nuclear warhead capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
T1237&#09;Submit KITs, KIQs, and intelligence requirements&#09;Once they have been created, intelligence requirements, Key Intelligence Topics (KITs), and Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs) are submitted into a central management system.<br/>
<br/>
T1240&#09;Task requirements&#09;Once divided into the most granular parts, analysts work with collection managers to task the collection management system with requirements and sub-requirements. </body></html>
