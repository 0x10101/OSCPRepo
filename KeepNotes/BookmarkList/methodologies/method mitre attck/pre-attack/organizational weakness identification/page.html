<br/>
T1300&#09;Analyze organizational skillsets and deficiencies&#09;Analyze strengths and weaknesses of the target for potential areas of where to focus compromise efforts.<br/>
<br/>
T1303&#09;Analyze presence of outsourced capabilities&#09;Outsourcing, the arrangement of one company providing goods or services to another company for something that could be done in-house, provides another avenue for an adversary to target. Businesses often have networks, portals, or other technical connections between themselves and their outsourced/partner organizations that could be exploited. Additionally, outsourced/partner organization information could provide opportunities for phishing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
T1298&#09;Assess vulnerability of 3rd party vendors&#09;Once a 3rd party vendor has been identified as being of interest it can be probed for vulnerabilities just like the main target would be. </body></html>
