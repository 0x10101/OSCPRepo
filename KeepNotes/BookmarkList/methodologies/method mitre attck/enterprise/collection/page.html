</head><body>&nbsp;Collection<br/>
Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate. <br/>
<br/>
ID&#09;Name&#09;Description<br/>
T1123&#09;Audio Capture&#09;An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., microphones and webcams) or applications (e.g., voice and video call services) to capture audio recordings for the purpose of listening into sensitive conversations to gather information.<br/>
<br/>
T1119&#09;Automated Collection&#09;Once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data. Methods for performing this technique could include use of Scripting to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals. This functionality could also be built into remote access tools.<br/>
<br/>
T1115&#09;Clipboard Data&#09;Adversaries may collect data stored in the Windows clipboard from users copying information within or between applications.<br/>
<br/>
T1213&#09;Data from Information Repositories&#09;Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information.<br/>
<br/>
T1005&#09;Data from Local System&#09;Sensitive data can be collected from local system sources, such as the file system or databases of information residing on the system prior to Exfiltration.<br/>
<br/>
T1039&#09;Data from Network Shared Drive&#09;Sensitive data can be collected from remote systems via shared network drives (host shared directory, network file server, etc.) that are accessible from the current system prior to Exfiltration.<br/>
<br/>
T1025&#09;Data from Removable Media&#09;Sensitive data can be collected from any removable media (optical disk drive, USB memory, etc.) connected to the compromised system prior to Exfiltration.<br/>
<br/>
T1074&#09;Data Staged&#09;Collected data is staged in a central location or directory prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as Data Compressed or Data Encrypted.<br/>
<br/>
T1114&#09;Email Collection&#09;Adversaries may target user email to collect sensitive information from a target.<br/>
<br/>
T1056&#09;Input Capture&#09;Adversaries can use methods of capturing user input for obtaining credentials for Valid Accounts and information Collection that include keylogging and user input field interception.<br/>
<br/>
T1185&#09;Man in the Browser&#09;Adversaries can take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality in browser software to change content, modify behavior, and intercept information as part of various man in the browser techniques.<br/>
<br/>
T1113&#09;Screen Capture&#09;Adversaries may attempt to take screen captures of the desktop to gather information over the course of an operation. Screen capturing functionality may be included as a feature of a remote access tool used in post-compromise operations.<br/>
<br/>
T1125&#09;Video Capture&#09;An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., integrated cameras or webcams) or applications (e.g., video call services) to capture video recordings for the purpose of gathering information. Images may also be captured from devices or applications, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.</body></html>
