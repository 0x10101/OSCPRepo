<title>Discovery</title>
</head><body>&nbsp;Discovery<br/>
Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the system and internal network. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system provides many native tools that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase. <br/>
<br/>
ID&#09;Name&#09;Description<br/>
T1087&#09;Account Discovery&#09;Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of local system or domain accounts.<br/>
<br/>
T1010&#09;Application Window Discovery&#09;Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of open application windows. Window listings could convey information about how the system is used or give context to information collected by a keylogger.<br/>
<br/>
T1217&#09;Browser Bookmark Discovery&#09;Adversaries may enumerate browser bookmarks to learn more about compromised hosts. Browser bookmarks may reveal personal information about users (ex: banking sites, interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure.<br/>
<br/>
T1482&#09;Domain Trust Discovery&#09;Adversaries may attempt to gather information on domain trust relationships that may be used to identify Lateral Movement opportunities in Windows multi-domain/forest environments. Domain trusts provide a mechanism for a domain to allow access to resources based on the authentication procedures of another domain. Domain trusts allow the users of the trusted domain to access resources in the trusting domain. The information discovered may help the adversary conduct SID-History Injection, Pass the Ticket, and Kerberoasting. Domain trusts can be enumerated using the DSEnumerateDomainTrusts() Win32 API call, .NET methods, and LDAP. The Windows utility Nltest is known to be used by adversaries to enumerate domain trusts.<br/>
<br/>
T1083&#09;File and Directory Discovery&#09;Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or may search in specific locations of a host or network share for certain information within a file system.<br/>
<br/>
T1046&#09;Network Service Scanning&#09;Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation. Methods to acquire this information include port scans and vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system.<br/>
<br/>
T1135&#09;Network Share Discovery&#09;Networks often contain shared network drives and folders that enable users to access file <br/>
directories on various systems across a network.<br/>
<br/>
T1040&#09;Network Sniffing&#09;Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.<br/>
<br/>
T1201&#09;Password Policy Discovery&#09;Password policies for networks are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through Brute Force. An adversary may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network. This would help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).<br/>
<br/>
T1120&#09;Peripheral Device Discovery&#09;Adversaries may attempt to gather information about attached peripheral devices and components connected to a computer system. The information may be used to enhance their awareness of the system and network environment or may be used for further actions.<br/>
<br/>
T1069&#09;Permission Groups Discovery&#09;Adversaries may attempt to find local system or domain-level groups and permissions settings.<br/>
<br/>
T1057&#09;Process Discovery&#09;Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a system. Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software running on systems within the network.<br/>
<br/>
T1012&#09;Query Registry&#09;Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, configuration, and installed software.<br/>
<br/>
T1018&#09;Remote System Discovery&#09;Adversaries will likely attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system. Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used. Adversaries may also use local host files in order to discover the hostname to IP address mappings of remote systems.<br/>
<br/>
T1063&#09;Security Software Discovery&#09;Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on the system. This may include things such as local firewall rules and anti-virus. These checks may be built into early-stage remote access tools.<br/>
<br/>
T1082&#09;System Information Discovery&#09;An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture.<br/>
<br/>
T1016&#09;System Network Configuration Discovery&#09;Adversaries will likely look for details about the network configuration and settings of systems they access or through information discovery of remote systems. Several operating system administration utilities exist that can be used to gather this information. Examples include Arp, ipconfig/ifconfig, nbtstat, and route.<br/>
<br/>
T1049&#09;System Network Connections Discovery&#09;Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of network connections to or from the compromised system they are currently accessing or from remote systems by querying for information over the network.<br/>
<br/>
T1033&#09;System Owner/User Discovery&#09;Adversaries may attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, set of users that commonly uses a system, or whether a user is actively using the system. They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using Credential Dumping. The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs.<br/>
<br/>
T1007&#09;System Service Discovery&#09;Adversaries may try to get information about registered services. Commands that may obtain information about services using operating system utilities are "sc," "tasklist /svc" using Tasklist, and "net start" using Net, but adversaries may also use other tools as well.<br/>
<br/>
T1124&#09;System Time Discovery&#09;The system time is set and stored by the Windows Time Service within a domain to maintain time synchronization between systems and services in an enterprise network.<br/>
<br/>
T1497&#09;Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion&#09;Adversaries may check for the presence of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox to avoid potential detection of tools and activities. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to conceal the core functions of the implant or disengage from the victim. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. </body></html>
