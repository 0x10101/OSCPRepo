<title>Privilege Escalation</title>
</head><body>&nbsp;Privilege Escalation<br/>
Privilege escalation includes techniques that allow an attacker to obtain a higher level of permissions on the mobile device. Attackers may enter the mobile device with very limited privileges and may be required to take advantage of a device weakness to obtain higher privileges necessary to successfully carry out their mission objectives. <br/>

T1404&#09;Exploit OS Vulnerability&#09;A malicious app can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in the operating system to obtain escalated privileges.<br/>
<br/>
T1405&#09;Exploit TEE Vulnerability&#09;A malicious app or other attack vector could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in code running within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) . The adversary could then obtain privileges held by the TEE potentially including the ability to access cryptographic keys or other sensitive data . Escalated operating system privileges may be first required in order to have the ability to attack the TEE . If not, privileges within the TEE can potentially be used to exploit the operating system .</body></html>
