<title>Exfiltration</title>
</head><body>&nbsp;Exfiltration<br/>
Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the adversary removing files and information from the targeted mobile device.<br/>
<br/>
In the mobile environment, mobile devices are frequently connected to networks outside enterprise control such as cellular networks or public Wi-Fi networks. Adversaries could attempt to evade detection by communicating on these networks, and potentially even by using non-Internet Protocol mechanisms such as Short Message Service (SMS). However, cellular networks often have data caps and/or extra data charges that could increase the potential for adversarial communication to be detected. <br/>

T1438&#09;Alternate Network Mediums&#09;Adversaries can communicate using cellular networks rather than enterprise Wi-Fi in order to bypass enterprise network monitoring systems. Adversaries may also communicate using other non-Internet Protocol mediums such as SMS, NFC, or Bluetooth to bypass network monitoring systems.<br/>
<br/>
T1436&#09;Commonly Used Port&#09;Adversaries may communicate over a commonly used port to bypass firewalls or network detection systems and to blend with normal network activity to avoid more detailed inspection. They may use commonly open ports such as<br/>
<br/>
T1437&#09;Standard Application Layer Protocol&#09;Adversaries may communicate using a common, standardized application layer protocol such as HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, or DNS to avoid detection by blending in with existing traffic.<br/>
