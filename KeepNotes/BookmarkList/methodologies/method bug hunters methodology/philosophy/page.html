<br/>
Single-sourced:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; looking mostly for common-ish vulns<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; not competing with others<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; incentivized for count<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; payment guaranteed and quality check based on approximation<br/>
<br/>
Crowdsourced: - looking for vulns that arenâ€™t as easy to find<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; racing vs. time<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; competitive vs. others<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; incentivized to find unique bugs<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; payment based on impact not number of findings<br/>
