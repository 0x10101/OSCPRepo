</head><body><b>Application Security Requirements</b><br/>
To produce a secure web application, you must define what secure means for that application. OWASP recommends you use the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS">OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)</a>&nbsp;as a guide for setting the security requirements for your application(s). If youâ€™re outsourcing, consider the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Secure_Software_Contract_Annex">OWASP Secure Software Contract Annex</a>. Note: The annex is for US contract law, so please consult qualified legal advice before using the sample annex. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Application Security Architecture</b><br/>
Rather than retrofitting security into your applications and APIs, it is far more cost effective to design the security in from the start. OWASP recommends the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cheat_Sheet_Series">OWASP Prevention Cheat Sheets</a>&nbsp;as a good starting point for guidance on how to design security in from the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Standard Security Controls</b><br/>
Building strong and usable security controls is difficult. Usingaset of standard security controls radically simplifies the development of secure applications and APIs. The <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls">OWASP Proactive Controls</a>&nbsp;is a good starting point for developers, and many modern frameworks now come with standard and effective security controls for authorization, validation, CSRF prevention, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Secure Development Lifecycle</b><br/>
To improve the process your organization follows when building applications and APIs, OWASP recommends the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_SAMM_Project">OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)</a>. This model helps organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing their organization.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Application Security Education</b><br/>
The <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Education_Project">OWASP Education Project</a>&nbsp;provides training materials to help educate developers on web application security. For hands-on learning about vulnerabilities, try <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/WebGoat">OWASP WebGoat</a>, WebGoat.NET, OWASP NodeJS Goat, OWASP Juice Shop Projector the OWASP Broken Web Applications Project. To stay current, come to an <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSec_Conference">OWASP AppSec Conference</a>, OWASP Conference Training, or local <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Chapter">OWASP Chapter meetings</a>. </body></html>
