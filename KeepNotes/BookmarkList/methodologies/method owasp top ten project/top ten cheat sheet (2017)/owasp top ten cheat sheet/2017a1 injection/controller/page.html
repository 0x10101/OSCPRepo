Canonicalize using correct character set Positive input validation using correct character set<br/>
<br/>
(NR) Negative input validation. (LR) Sanitize input.<br/>
<br/>
Tip: updating a negative list (such as looking for "script", "sCrIpT", "ßCrîpt", etc) will require expensive and constant deployments and will always fail as attackers work out your list of "bad" words. Positive validation is simpler, faster and usually more secure and needs updating far less than any other validation mechanism.</body></html>
