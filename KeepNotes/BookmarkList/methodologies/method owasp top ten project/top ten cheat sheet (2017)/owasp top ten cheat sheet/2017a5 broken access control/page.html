<title>2017:A5 Broken Access Control</title>

<br/>
<b>Is the Application Vulnerable?</b><br/>
Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of all data, or performing a business function outside of the limits of the user. Common access control vulnerabilities include:<br/>
•Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL, internal application state, or the HTML page, or simply using a custom API attack tool.<br/>
•Allowing the primary key to be changed to another users record, permitting viewing or editing someone else's account.<br/>
•Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in, or acting as an admin when logged in as a user.<br/>
•Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT)access control token or a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges, or abusing JWT invalidation<br/>
•CORS misconfiguration allows unauthorized API access.<br/>
•Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user. Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How to Prevent</b><br/>
Access control is only effective if enforced in trusted server-side code or server-less API, where the attacker cannot modify the access control check or metadata.<br/>
•With the exception of public resources, deny by default.<br/>
•Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application, including minimizing CORS usage.<br/>
•Model access controls should enforce record ownership, rather than accepting that the user can create, read, update, or delete any record.<br/>
•Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by domain models.<br/>
•Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g. .git) and backup files are not present within web roots.<br/>
•Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g. repeated failures).<br/>
•Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling.<br/>
•JWT tokens should be invalidated on the server after logout.Developers and QA staff should include functional access control unit and integration tests.<br/>

<b>Example Attack Scenarios</b><br/>
Scenario #1: The application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:<br/>
pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter("acct"));ResultSetresults = pstmt.executeQuery( );<br/>
<br/>
An attacker simply modifies the 'acct' parameter in the browser to send whatever account number they want. If not properly verified, the attacker can access any user's account.<br/>
http://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct<br/>
<br/>
Scenario #2: An attacker simply force browses to target URLs. Admin rights are required for access to the admin page.<br/>
http://example.com/app/getappInfo<br/>
http://example.com/app/admin_getappInfoIf <br/>
<br/>
an unauthenticated user can access either page, it’s a flaw. If a non-admin can access the adminpage, this is a flaw.<br/>
