<title>Whats Next for Organizations</title>
</head><body><b>Get Started</b><br/>
•Document all applications and associated data assets. Larger organizations should consider implementing a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) for this purpose.<br/>
•Establish an <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Strategy_&_Metrics_-_1">application security program</a>&nbsp;and drive adoption. <br/>
•Conduct a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Strategy_&_Metrics_-_3">capability gap analysis comparing your organization to your peers</a>&nbsp;to define keyimprovement areas and an execution plan. <br/>
•Gain management approval and establish an <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Education_&_Guidance_-_1">application security awareness campaign</a>&nbsp;for the entire IT organization.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Risk Based Portfolio Approach</b><br/>
•Identify the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Strategy_&_Metrics_-_2">protection needs</a>&nbsp;of your <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Strategy_&_Metrics_-_2">application portfolio</a>&nbsp;from a business perspective.This should be driven in part by privacy laws and other regulations relevant to the data asset being protected. <br/>
•Establish a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology">common risk rating model</a>&nbsp;with a consistent set of likelihood and impact factors reflective of your organization's tolerance for risk. <br/>
•Accordingly measure and prioritize all your applications and APIs. Add the results to your CMDB. <br/>
•Establish assurance guidelines to properly define coverage and level of rigor required.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Enable with a Strong Foundation</b><br/>
•Establish a set of focused <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Policy_&_Compliance_-_2">policies and standards</a>&nbsp;that provide an application security baseline for all development teams to adhere to.<br/>
•Define a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Security_Knowledge_Framework">common set of reusable security controls</a>&nbsp;that complement these policies and standards and provide design and development guidance on their use.<br/>
•Establish an <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Education_&_Guidance_-_2">application security training curriculum</a>&nbsp;that is required and targeted to differentdevelopment roles and topics.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Integrate Security into Existing Processes</b><br/>
•Define and integrate <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Construction">secure implementation</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Verification">verification</a>&nbsp;activities into existing development and operational processes. Activities include <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Threat_Assessment_-_1">threat modeling</a>, secure design and <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Design_Review_-_1">design review</a>, secure coding and <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Code_Review_-_1">code review</a>, <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SAMM_-_Security_Testing_-_1">penetration testing</a>, and remediation.<br/>
•Provide subject matter experts and support services for development and project teamsto be successful.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Provide Management Visibility</b><br/>
•Manage with metrics. Drive improvement and funding decisions based on the metrics and analysis data captured. Metrics include adherence to security practices and activities, vulnerabilities introduced, vulnerabilities mitigated, application coverage, defect density by type and instance counts, etc.<br/>
•Analyze data from the implementation and verification activities to look for root cause and vulnerability patterns to drive strategic and systemic improvements across the enterprise.Learn from mistakes and offer positive incentives to promote improvements.</body></html>
