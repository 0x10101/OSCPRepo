<title>Deployment Models</title>
</head><body>Cloud Deployment Models<br/>
Depending on the deployment model, the provider and tenant may be part of the same organization, or they could be completely different companies. Obviously this is a point you will want to ensure is clarified before defining the scope of your testing. Potential models include:<br/>
<ul><li>Private - Typically the cloud is deployed on a local LAN. The provider and tenant are part of the same organization, but not necessarily part of the same workgroup or division.</li>
<li>Public - Typically the provider offers compute, storage, network, etc. as a service that is consumed by the tenant on a pay for use basis. In this deployment model the provider and tenant are almost always part of different organizations.</li>
<li>Community - Possibly a private or public deployment, a community cloud is managed and consumed by multiple entities that share a similar business model. For example a government could choose to set up a community cloud that is then consumed by different government agencies.</li>
<li>Hybrid - A deployment that combines aspects of two or more of the above deployment models, as well as possibly including multiple service models (covered in detail later).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Identifying the deployment model is crucial to defining scope. For example if you will be testing a private cloud deployment, it may be possible to do a full cloud stack assessment. If however it is a public deployment, you will need to understand the delineation point between provider and tenant. Note that even if it is a provider that is contracting your services, there will most likely be cloud layers that are out of scope. A public provider that is identified as breaking into the tenant's domain without permission is going to quickly lose customers. You as a penetration tester should avoid such potentially difficult political situations.<br/>
