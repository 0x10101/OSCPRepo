<title>Cloning Issues</title>
</head><body><i>IaaS Cloning Issues</i><br/>
On a legacy network, operating systems are typically loaded manually. This means that it is not uncommon to find variations in both configuration and patch level. In IaaS deployments, we use the concept of a gold standard image. The image is a VM that has been created manually and tweaked with all required applications, patches, and configuration changes. When a new server is required, the gold standard image is <a href="http://www.vmware.com/support/ws55/doc/ws_clone_overview.html">cloned</a>, and that clone is made available to the tenant. It is not uncommon for providers to offer up a catalog of servers available for cloning. For example there may be one standard image with a Web server preloaded, another with a database server, variations that use Linux or Windows for the underlying OS, and so on.<br/>

However consistency can be a double edged sword. On the plus side, if I've implemented a change that increases the security posture of my servers, I can be sure that this change will be implemented across my infrastructure. On the down side, it means that any insecure settings will also be propagated across my infrastructure. So when you are performing a penetration test, if you are lucky enough to find a point of entry, that vulnerability will most likely exist in every VM performing a similar role within the infrastructure. This provides opportunities for pivoting to other systems, just remember to always operate within your scope and rules of engagement.<br/>
