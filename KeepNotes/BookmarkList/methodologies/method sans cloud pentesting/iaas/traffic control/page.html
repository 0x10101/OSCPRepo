Another possible issue is that there may be little to no firewalling limiting access to the VM. In a private IaaS deployment, the cloud will be behind the perimeter so this should be a non-issue. In a public cloud however, the VM may spin up unprotected. Even if packet level control is in use, the protection may be minimal. For example if you are using Amazon EC2 <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html">security groups</a>, the basic service only permits security groups to be assigned <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=78175">at the time the VM is initiated</a>. This can make it extremely difficult to change firewall policies while the VMs are in operation. The result is that some basic customers simply create a single security group that permits all traffic, so they do not run into complication later.<br/>
