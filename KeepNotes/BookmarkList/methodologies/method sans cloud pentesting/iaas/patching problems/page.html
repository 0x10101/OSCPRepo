<title>Patching Problems</title>
</head><body><i>IaaS Patching Problems</i><br/>
Nowhere is this more apparent than VMs in public space. With public IaaS clouds, most providers supply unpatched versions of the operating system. Further, remote administration is enabled so that the tenant is able to gain access to their VM. For Linux systems, this is usually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a>. For Windows systems, this is usually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol">RDP</a>. Needless to say an unpatched OS with remote administration enabled makes for a tempting target.<br/>
<br/>
There are additional issues which can exaggerate this problem even further. To start, providers charge for network and CPU usage. This means that it costs money to patch your servers. A cost conscious tenant may choose to avoid these charges by skipping the patching process. Also, most providers do not enable automatic patching by default. This means that at the very least the tenant has to reconfigure the server to have it patch automatically. However in some environments this may not be an option. For example Microsoft requires that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/gg465391.aspx">automatic patching be disabled</a>&nbsp;on any VM role deployed within Azure. So each server will only get patched when the administrator logs in and manually initiates the process.<br/>
