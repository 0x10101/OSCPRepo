<title>Attacking the Hypervisor</title>
</head><body><i>Attacking The Hypervisor</i><br/>
Most of the above advice on IaaS cloud assumes that you have been contracted by a tenant. What if you are being contracted by a provider? How does this change our scope?<br/>
<br/>
Testing the provider obviously means that most of the VMs will be out of scope. It may be possible to have the provider launch a few specific images, if you feel they could be leveraged during your testing. For example you may wish to test for susceptibility to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCPFlwSCmvU">VM escape attacks</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If you are testing a provider however, one of the juicier targets is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor">hypervisor</a>&nbsp;itself. Since the hypervisor ties all of the VMs together, ownership of the hypervisor could potentially lead to access on every VM. <br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
One of the popular trends is to implement security via the hypervisor using a technique called <a href="http://www.virtualizationpractice.com/anti-this-anti-that-getting-into-the-virtualization-security-game-with-introspection-5059/">introspection</a>. With introspection, the hypervisor can potentially access both memory and disk within each VM. While this can help augment security, it can also create <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/hypervisor-vs-hostbased-security.pdf">points of insecurity</a>. One of the more interesting caveats is that introspection access to the VM's memory and disk bypasses local access controls and logging. So if I can leverage introspection to scrape data off of a VM, the VM itself will have no audit trail of the data being accessed. Whether the access is recorded at all will come down to controls within the hypervisor's host environment. &nbsp;</body></html>
