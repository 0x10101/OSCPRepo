<title>SaaS</title>
</head><body>Software as a Service<br/>
Software as a Service is designed to be a turnkey solution for the tenant. So if it is a tenant that is contracting your services, there is very little testing that can be considered in scope. This may be limited to ensuring that interactions with the application interface are being properly secured, API keys are being managed appropriately, and so on. Tools such as <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project">Webscarab</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://portswigger.net/burp/">Burp</a>&nbsp;can be extremely helpful in analyzing this interaction. For the layers under the provider's control, your client may be able to <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/iaas-provider-auditing.mp4">audit their security posture</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If you are being contracted by a provider, most of the above advice for IaaS and PaaS will be applicable here as well. SaaS may actually reduce the number of individuals reviewing the code even further, so ensure you are comprehensive in your testing. Common coding mistakes such as the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">OWASP top 10</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://www.sans.org/top25-software-errors/">SANS top 25 coding errors</a>&nbsp;may help to get the creative juices flowing.<br/>
<br/>
While some SaaS deployments execute the application completely within the provider's cloud environment, some include a local agent that is designed to run on one of more tenant systems. The most common example is some SaaS based security solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Again, there are many inexperienced coders moving into this space. Look for agents that do little to secure their own deployment. Is the agent simply a set of scripts that can be easily modified? Can the agent easily be turned against the local system? Does the solution have any way of verifying whether the agent has been compromised? You may be surprised by what you find.<br/>
