</head><body>Cloud Service Models<br/>
For each of the above described deployment models, different <i>service models </i>can be used to deploy resources. The service model defines which resources the provider brings to the table, as well as which resources the tenant will be responsible for supplying. Per the <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-145/SP800-145.pdf">NIST SP800-145</a>&nbsp;definition, here are the three cloud service models:<br/>
<ul><li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - The provider supplies hardware and network connectivity. The tenant is responsible for the virtual machine and everything that runs within it.</li>
<li>Platform as a Service (PaaS) - The tenant supplies the application they wish to deploy, and the provider supplies all the components required to run the application.</li>
<li>Software as a Service (SaaS) - The provider supplies the application and all the components required to run it. SaaS is designed to be a turnkey solution for the tenant.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Just from this brief description you can see that the service model will directly impact the scope of our testing. For example if we are being contracted by a tenant, an IaaS service model would require the most testing. Little to no testing would be possible for the tenant if a SaaS based service model is in use.<br/>
