<title>PaaS</title>
</head><body>Platform as a Service<br/>
With Platform as a Service, the delineation point between provider and tenant moves up the stack. This places the application stack and everything below it in scope for provider testing only. If we have been contracted by a tenant, scope is limited to their application and any available interface. Beyond that, much of the advice above can potentially be leveraged for PaaS environments as well.<br/>
<br/>
From a security perspective, public PaaS can put a tenant in a bit of a quandary. Many public PaaS providers prohibit penetration testing of client applications. This is because the testing can potentially impact other tenants as well as the provider. For example if you are able to break an application and gain high level system permissions, the system is actually owned by the provider, not the tenant, which obviously places it out of scope. So the quandary becomes, how do I deploy a secure application if the provider will not let me test security?<br/>
<br/>
There are a few possible ways around this problem. One alternative is to focus on code review. This may require full white box testing, but at least it gives us something to fall back on. The other possibility is that some organizations run a private PaaS cloud for development, while leveraging a public PaaS cloud for production. If the organization contracting your services has a development environment, you may be able to leverage it for application testing.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting aspect of PaaS is that it changes the paradigm of application development. In the past, applications were developed by relatively few vendors and then released to the world en masse'. Each customer would receive a local copy of the software, and there would be thousands if not millions of copies of the software in distribution. Mass distribution enabled a large number of individuals to review the application for security. Any concerns could then be conveyed to the vendor or openly discussed through <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/description">Bugtraq</a>&nbsp;or other communication channels.<br/>
<br/>
PaaS uses a far more limited distribution model. Most applications are being developed by the organization that plans to use them. So there are fewer copies of the code in existence, which means fewer eyes reviewing the code for security. Further, PaaS applications are typically written to live within only a few PaaS clouds. Since the cloud is owned by the provider, this decreases the opportunity for third parties to scrutinize the code.<br/>
<br/>
How does this impact us as penetration testers? Because of this development process, it becomes far easier to find common mistakes. You may actually find it fruitful to try extremely common attack vectors such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross-site scripting</a>. Remember that a lot of inexperienced coders are moving into the PaaS development space. Be as complete as possible with your testing.<br/>
