<title>Shared Responsibility</title>
</head><body>Arguably one of the biggest disruptions that cloud computing brings to penetration testing is the concept of shared ownership. In the past, if an organization contracted you for services, they would typically own all of the components on their network. This would open up all layers of the OSI for potential testing. In a cloud environment, it is entirely possible that the contracting organization controls very few of those layers. This requires additional up front work to ensure your testing remains in scope and does not negatively impact any third parties.<br/>
<br/>
Here are two terms you need to be familiar with:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Provider - The entity that built the cloud deployment, and is offering metered service to one or more tenants.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tenant - The entity that is contracting the metered service from the provider.<br/>
<br/>
One of the first points you need to clarify when determining scope is whether the organization is a cloud provider or tenant. Note in certain cases there may be multiple clouds where the organization acts as a provider for one, and a tenant for others.</body></html>
