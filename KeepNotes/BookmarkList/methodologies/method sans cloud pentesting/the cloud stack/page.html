<title>The Cloud Stack</title>
</head><body>The Cloud Stack<br/>
Let's look at the different layers that go into building a cloud solution. We can then map these layers against each of the above service models to identify scope of testing for each. The layers or components that go into building a cloud solution are:<br/>
<ul><li>Facility - The actual physical building where the cloud solution will be located.</li>
<li>Network - This can be a physical or virtual network. It is responsible for carrying communications between systems and possibly the Internet.</li>
<li>Compute and Storage — The physical hardware that will supply CPU time as well as file storage.</li>
<li>Hypervisor - This is an optional component. When virtualization is used to manage resources, the hypervisor is responsible for allocating resources to each virtual machine. It may also be leveraged for implementing security.</li>
<li>Virtual Machine (VM) or Operating System (OS) — In a virtualized environment, the VM is the virtual container responsible for running the operating system. If no hypervisor is present, the operating system runs directly on the compute and storage hardware.</li>
<li>Solution Stack - This is the programming language used to build and deploy applications. Good examples are .NET, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc.</li>
<li>Application - The actual application being used by one or more tenants, or their customers.</li>
<li>Application Program Interface (API) or Graphical User Interface (GUI) - The interface used by the tenant or their customers to interact with the application. The most common API is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_services">RESTful HTTP or HTTPS</a>. The most common GUI is an HTTP or HTTPS based Web site.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
When we combine all of these layers, we get a cloud solution. As penetration testers, we need to be able to identify which of these layers are in scope for our testing. As mentioned earlier, scope will be heavily driven by both deployment model and service model. Whether the organization contracting our services is a provider or tenant will also factor into the scope.<br/>
