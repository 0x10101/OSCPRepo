</b><b>Testing for Weak SSL/TLS Cipher Suites </b><br/>
Check the configuration of the web servers that provide https services. If the web application provides other SSL/TLS wrapped services, these should be checked as well. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Example 9. Windows Server <br/>
Check the configuration on a Microsoft Windows Server (2000, 2003 and 2008) using the registry key: <br/>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\<br/>
<br/>
that has some sub-keys including Ciphers, Protocols and KeyExchangeAlgorithms. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Example 10: Apache <br/>
To check the cipher suites and protocols supported by the Apache2 web server, open the ssl.conf file and search for the SSLCipherSuite, SSLProtocol, SSLHonorCipherOrder,SSLInsecureRenegotiation and SSLCompression directives. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Testing SSL certificate validity â€“ client and server <br/>
Examine the validity of the certificates used by the application at both server and client levels. The usage of certificates is primarily at the web server level, however, there may be additional communication paths protected by SSL (for example, towards the DBMS). Testers should check the application architecture to identify all SSL protected channels. <br/>
