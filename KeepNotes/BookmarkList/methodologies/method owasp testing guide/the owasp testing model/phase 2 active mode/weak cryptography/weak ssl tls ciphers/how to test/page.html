</head><body><b>How to Test <br/>
</b><b>Testing for sensitive data transmitted in clear-text </b><br/>
Various types of information which must be protected can be also transmitted in clear text. It is possible to check if this information is transmitted over HTTP instead of HTTPS. Please refer to specific tests for full details, for credentials [3] and other kind of data [2]. <br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;Example 1</b>. Basic Authentication over HTTP <br/>
A typical example is the usage of Basic Authentication over HTTP because with Basic Authentication, after log in, credentials are encoded - and not encrypted - into HTTP Headers. <br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
$ curl -kis http://example.com/restricted/<br/>
HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required<br/>

&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;401 Authorization Required&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;<br/>
&lt;body bgcolor=white&gt;<br/>
&lt;h1&gt;401 Authorization Required&lt;/h1&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;<br/>

<b>Testing for Weak SSL/TLS Ciphers/Protocols/Keys vulnerabilities </b><br/>
The large number of available cipher suites and quick progress in cryptanalysis makes testing an SSL server a non-trivial task. <br/>
<br/>
At the time of writing these criteria are widely recognized as minimum checklist: <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Weak ciphers must not be used (e.g. less than 128 bits [10]; no NULL ciphers suite, due to no encryption used; no Anonymous Diffie-Hellmann, due to not provides authentication).</li>
<li>&nbsp;Weak protocols must be disabled (e.g. SSLv2 must be disabled, due to known weaknesses in protocol design [11]).</li>
<li>&nbsp;Renegotiation must be properly configured (e.g. Insecure Renegotiation must be disabled, due to MiTM attacks [12] and Client-initiated Renegotiation must be disabled, due to Denial of Service vulnerability [13]).</li>
<li>&nbsp;No Export (EXP) level cipher suites, due to can be easly broken [10].</li>
<li>&nbsp;X.509 certificates key length must be strong (e.g. if RSA or DSA is used the key must be at least 1024 bits).</li>
<li>&nbsp;X.509 certificates must be signed only with secure hashing algoritms (e.g. not signed using MD5 hash, due to known collision attacks on this hash).</li>
<li>&nbsp;Keys must be generated with proper entropy (e.g, Weak Key Generated with Debian) [14].</li>
</ul>
<br/>
A more complete checklist includes: <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Secure Renegotiation should be enabled.</li>
<li>&nbsp;MD5 should not be used, due to known collision attacks. [35]</li>
<li>&nbsp;RC4 should not be used, due to crypto-analytical attacks [15].</li>
<li>&nbsp;Server should be protected from BEAST Attack [16].</li>
<li>&nbsp;Server should be protected from CRIME attack, TLS compression must be disabled [17].</li>
<li>&nbsp;Server should support Forward Secrecy [18].</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The following standards can be used as reference while assessing SSL servers: <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;PCI-DSS v2.0 in point 4.1 requires compliant parties to use "strong cryptography" without precisely defining key lengths and algorithms. Common interpretation, partially based on previous versions of the standard, is that at least 128 bit key cipher, no export strength algorithms and no SSLv2 should be used [19].</li>
<li>&nbsp;Qualsys SSL Labs Server Rating Guide [14], Deployment best practice [10] and SSL Threat Model [20] has been proposed to standardize SSL server assessment and configuration. But is less updated than the SSL Server tool [21].</li>
<li>&nbsp;OWASP has a lot of resources about SSL/TLS Security [22], [23], [24], [25]. [26].</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Some tools and scanners both free (e.g. SSLAudit [28] or SSLScan [29]) and commercial (e.g. Tenable Nessus [27]), can be used to assess SSL/TLS vulnerabilities. But due to evolution of these vulnerabilities a good way to test is to check them manually with openssl [30] or use the tool’s output as an input for manual evaluation using the references. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the SSL/TLS enabled service is not directly accessible and the tester can access it only via a HTTP proxy using CONNECT method [36]. Most of the tools will try to connect to desired tcp port to start SSL/TLS handshake. This will not work since desired port is accessible only via HTTP proxy. The tester can easily circumvent this by using relaying software such as socat [37]. <br/>
<br/>
<b>SSL service recognition via nmap </b><br/>
The first step is to identify ports which have SSL/TLS wrapped services. Typically tcp ports with SSL for web and mail services are - but not limited to - 443 (https), 465 (ssmtp), 585 (imap4-ssl), 993 (imaps), 995 (ssl-pop). <br/>
In this example we search for SSL services using nmap with “-sV” option, used to identify services and it is also able to identify SSL services [31]. Other options are for this particular example and must be customized. Often in a Web Application Penetration Test scope is limited to port 80 and 443. <br/>

<b>Checking for Client-initiated Renegotiation and Secure Renegotiation via openssl (manually) </b><br/>
Openssl [30] can be used for testing manually SSL/TLS. In this example the tester tries to initiate a renegotiation by client [m] connecting to server with openssl. The tester then writes the fist line of an HTTP request and types “R” in a new line. He then waits for renegotiaion and completion of the HTTP request and checks if secure renegotiaion is supported by looking at the server output. Using manual requests it is also possible to see if Compression is enabled for TLS and to check for CRIME [13], for ciphers and for other vulnerabilities<br/>
$ openssl s_client -connect www2.example.com:443<br/>

<b>Testing supported Cipher Suites, BEAST and CRIME attacks via TestSSLServer </b><br/>
TestSSLServer [32] is a script which permits the tester to check the cipher suite and also for BEAST and CRIME attacks. BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS) exploits a vulnerability of CBC in TLS 1.0. CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy) exploits a vulnerability of TLS Compression, that should be disabled. What is interesting is that the first fix for BEAST was the use of RC4, but this is now discouraged due to a crypto-analytical attack to RC4 [15]. <br/>
<br/>
An online tool to check for these attacks is SSL Labs, but can be used only for internet facing servers. Also consider that target data will be stored on SSL Labs server and also will result some connection from SSL Labs server [21]. <br/>

<b>&nbsp;Testing SSL/TLS with testssl.sh </b><br/>
Testssl.sh [38] is a Linux shell script which provides clear output to facilitate good decision making. It can not only check web servers but also services on other ports, supports STARTTLS, SNI, SPDY and does a few check on the HTTP header as well. <br/>
<br/>
It's a very easy to use tool. Here's some sample output (without colors): <br/>

STARTTLS would be tested via testssl.sh -t smtp.gmail.com:587 smtp, each ciphers with testssl -e &lt;target&gt;, each ciphers per protocol with testssl -E &lt;target&gt;. To just display what local ciphers that are installed for openssl see testssl -V. For a thorough check it is best to dump the supplied OpenSSL binaries in the path or the one of testssl.sh. <br/>
<br/>
The interesting thing is if a tester looks at the sources they learn how features are tested, see e.g. Example 4. What is even better is that it does the whole handshake for heartbleed in pure /bin/bash with /dev/tcp sockets -- no piggyback perl/python/you name it. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally it provides a prototype (via "testssl.sh -V") of mapping to RFC cipher suite names to OpenSSL ones. The tester needs the file mapping-rfc.txt in same directory. <br/>

<br/>
<b>Testing SSL certificate validity – client and server </b><br/>
Firstly upgrade the browser because CA certs expire and in every release of the browser these are renewed. Examine the validity of the certificates used by the application. Browsers will issue a warning when encountering expired certificates, certificates issued by untrusted CAs, and certificates which do not match name wise with the site to which they should refer. <br/>
<br/>
By clicking on the padlock that appears in the browser window when visiting an HTTPS site, testers can look at information related to the certificate – including the issuer, period of validity, encryption characteristics, etc. If the application requires a client certificate, that tester has probably installed one to access it. Certificate information is available in the browser by inspecting the relevant certificate(s) in the list of the installed certificates. <br/>
<br/>
These checks must be applied to all visible SSL-wrapped communication channels used by the application. Though this is the usual https service running on port 443, there may be additional services involved depending on the web application architecture and on deployment issues (an HTTPS administrative port left open, HTTPS services on non-standard ports, etc.). Therefore, apply these checks to all SSL-wrapped ports which have been discovered. For example, the nmap scanner features a scanning mode (enabled by the –sV command line switch) which identifies SSL-wrapped services. The Nessus vulnerability scanner has the capability of performing SSL checks on all SSL/TLS-wrapped services. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Example 1. Testing for certificate validity (manually) <br/>
Rather than providing a fictitious example, this guide includes an anonymized real-life example to stress how frequently one stumbles on https sites whose certificates are inaccurate with respect to naming. The following screenshots refer to a regional site of a high-profile IT company. <br/>
We are visiting a .it site and the certificate was issued to a .com site. Internet Explorer warns that the name on the certificate does not match the name of the site. <br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
The message issued by Firefox is different. Firefox complains because it cannot ascertain the identity of the .com site the certificate refers to because it does not know the CA which signed the certificate. In fact, Internet Explorer and Firefox do not come pre-loaded with the same list of CAs. Therefore, the behavior experienced with various browsers may differ. &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
<b>Testing for other vulnerabilities </b><br/>
As mentioned previously, there are other types of vulnerabilities that are not related with the SSL/TLS protocol used, the cipher suites or Certificates. Apart from other vulnerabilities discussed in other parts of this guide, a vulnerability exists when the server provides the website both with the HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and permits an attacker to force a victim into using a non-secure channel instead of a secure one. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;Surf Jacking </b><br/>
The Surf Jacking attack [7] was first presented by Sandro Gauci and permits to an attacker to hijack an HTTP session even when the victim’s connection is encrypted using SSL or TLS. <br/>
<br/>
The following is a scenario of how the attack can take place: <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Victim logs into the secure website at <a href="https://somesecuresite/">https://somesecuresite/</a>.</li>
<li>&nbsp;The secure site issues a session cookie as the client logs in.</li>
<li>&nbsp;While logged in, the victim opens a new browser window and goes to http:// examplesite/</li>
<li>&nbsp;An attacker sitting on the same network is able to see the clear text traffic to <a href="http://examplesite">http://examplesite</a>.</li>
<li>&nbsp;The attacker sends back a "301 Moved Permanently" in response to the clear text traffic to <a href="http://examplesite">http://examplesite</a>. The response contains the header “Location: <a href="http://somesecuresite">http://somesecuresite</a>&nbsp;/”, which makes it appear that examplesite is sending the web browser to somesecuresite. Notice that the URL scheme is HTTP not HTTPS.</li>
<li>&nbsp;The victim's browser starts a new clear text connection to <a href="http://somesecuresite/">http://somesecuresite/</a>&nbsp;and sends an HTTP request containing the cookie in the HTTP header in clear text</li>
<li>&nbsp;The attacker sees this traffic and logs the cookie for later use.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
To test if a website is vulnerable carry out the following tests: <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Check if website supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols</li>
<li>&nbsp;Check if cookies do not have the “Secure” flag</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;SSL Strip </b><br/>
Some applications supports both HTTP and HTTPS, either for usability or so users can type both addresses and get to the site. Often users go into an HTTPS website from link or a redirect. Typically personal banking sites have a similar configuration with an iframed log in or a form with action attribute over HTTPS but the page under HTTP. <br/>
<br/>
An attacker in a privileged position - as described in SSL strip [8] - can intercept traffic when the user is in the http site and manipulate it to get a Man-In-The-Middle attack under HTTPS. An application is vulnerable if it supports both HTTP and HTTPS. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;Testing via HTTP proxy </b><br/>
Inside corporate environments testers can see services that are not directly accessible and they can access them only via HTTP proxy using the CONNECT method [36]. Most of the tools will not work in this scenario because they try to connect to the desired tcp port to start the SSL/TLS handshake. With the help of relaying software such as socat [37] testers can enable those tools for use with services behind an HTTP proxy. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Example 8. Testing via HTTP proxy <br/>
To connect to destined.application.lan:443 via proxy 10.13.37.100:3128 run socat as follows: <br/>
$ socat TCP-LISTEN:9999,reuseaddr,fork PROXY:10.13.37.100:destined.application.lan:443,proxyport=3128<br/>
<br/>
Then the tester can target all other tools to localhost:9999: &nbsp; <br/>
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:9999<br/>
<br/>
All connections to localhost:9999 will be effectively relayed by socat via proxy to destined.application.lan:443. &nbsp; </body></html>
