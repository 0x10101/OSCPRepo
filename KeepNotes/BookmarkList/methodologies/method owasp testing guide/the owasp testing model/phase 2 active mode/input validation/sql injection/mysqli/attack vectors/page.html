<title>Attack Vectors</title>
</head><body><b>Attack vectors <br/>
</b><b>Write in a File </b><br/>
If the connected user has <b>FILE</b>&nbsp;privileges and single quotes are not escaped, the 'into outfile' clause can be used to export query results in a file. <br/>
&nbsp;Select * from table into outfile '/tmp/file' &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Note: there is no way to bypass single quotes surrounding a filename. So if there's some sanitization on single quotes like escape (\') there will be no way to use the 'into outfile' clause. <br/>
<br/>
This kind of attack could be used as an out-of-band technique to gain information about the results of a query or to write a file which could be executed inside the web server directory. <br/>
<br/>
Example: <br/>
&nbsp;1 limit 1 into outfile '/var/www/root/test.jsp' FIELDS ENCLOSED BY '//' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n&lt;%jsp code here%&gt;'; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Result Expected:</b><br/>
Results are stored in a file with rw-rw-rw privileges owned by MySQL user and group. <br/>
Where <i>/var/www/root/test.jsp</i>&nbsp;will contain: <br/>
&nbsp;//field values// &lt;%jsp code here%&gt; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;Read from a File </b><br/>
Load_file is a native function that can read a file when allowed by the file system permissions. If a connected user has <b>FILE</b>&nbsp;privileges, it could be used to get the files' content. Single quotes escape sanitization can by bypassed by using previously described techniques. <br/>
&nbsp;load_file('filename') &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Result Expected:</b><br/>
The whole file will be available for exporting by using standard techniques. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;Standard SQL Injection Attack </b><br/>
In a standard SQL injection you can have results displayed directly in a page as normal output or as a MySQL error. By using already mentioned SQL Injection attacks and the already described MySQL features, direct SQL injection could be easily accomplished at a level depth depending primarily on the MySQL version the pentester is facing. <br/>
<br/>
A good attack is to know the results by forcing a function/procedure or the server itself to throw an error. A list of errors thrown by MySQL and in particular native functions could be found on <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/error-messages-server.html">MySQL Manual</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;Out of band SQL Injection </b><br/>
Out of band injection could be accomplished by using the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_MySQL#Write_in_a_File">'into outfile'</a>&nbsp;clause. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;Blind SQL Injection </b><br/>
For blind SQL injection, there is a set of useful function natively provided by MySQL server. <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;String Length: &nbsp;<i>LENGTH(str)</i></li>
<li>&nbsp;Extract a substring from a given string: &nbsp;<i>SUBSTRING(string, offset, #chars_returned)</i></li>
<li>&nbsp;Time based Blind Injection: BENCHMARK and SLEEP &nbsp;<i>BENCHMARK(#ofcycles,action_to_be_performed )</i>&nbsp; The benchmark function could be used to perform timing attacks, when blind injection by boolean values does not yield any results. &nbsp;See. SLEEP() (MySQL &gt; 5.0.x) for an alternative on benchmark.</li>
</ul>
