</head><body><b>Summary </b><br/>
<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a>&nbsp;vulnerabilities occur whenever input is used in the construction of a SQL query without being adequately constrained or sanitized. The use of dynamic SQL (the construction of SQL queries by concatenation of strings) opens the door to these vulnerabilities. SQL injection allows an attacker to access the SQL servers. It allows for the execution of SQL code under the privileges of the user used to connect to the database. <br/>
<br/>
<i>MySQL server</i>&nbsp;has a few particularities so that some exploits need to be specially customized for this application. That's the subject of this section. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;How to Test </b><br/>
When an SQL injection vulnerability is found in an application backed by a MySQL database, there are a number of attacks that could be performed depending on the MySQL version and user privileges on DBMS. <br/>
<br/>
MySQL comes with at least four versions which are used in production worldwide, 3.23.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.x and 5.0.x. Every version has a set of features proportional to version number. <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;From Version 4.0: UNION </li>
<li>&nbsp;From Version 4.1: Subqueries</li>
<li>&nbsp;From Version 5.0: Stored procedures, Stored functions and the view named INFORMATION_SCHEMA</li>
<li>&nbsp;From Version 5.0.2: Triggers </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that for MySQL versions before 4.0.x, only Boolean or time-based Blind Injection attacks could be used, since the subquery functionality or UNION statements were not implemented. <br/>
<br/>
From now on, we will assume that there is a classic SQL injection vulnerability, which can be triggered by a request similar to the the one described in the Section on <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_SQL_Injection_(OWASP-DV-005)">Testing for SQL Injection</a>. <br/>

<b>&nbsp;The Single Quotes Problem </b><br/>
Before taking advantage of MySQL features, it has to be taken in consideration how strings could be represented in a statement, as often web applications escape single quotes. <br/>
<br/>
MySQL quote escaping is the following:<br/>
<b>&nbsp;'A string with \'quotes\'' </b>&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
That is, MySQL interprets escaped apostrophes (\') as characters and not as metacharacters. <br/>
<br/>
So if the application, to work properly, needs to use constant strings, two cases are to be differentiated: <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Web app escapes single quotes (' =&gt; \')</li>
<li>&nbsp;Web app does not escape single quotes (' =&gt; ')</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Under MySQL, there is a standard way to bypass the need of single quotes, having a constant string to be declared without the need for single quotes. <br/>
<br/>
Let's suppose we want to know the value of a field named 'password' in a record, with a condition like the following: <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;password like 'A%'</li>
<li>&nbsp;The ASCII values in a concatenated hex:</li>
<li>&nbsp;password LIKE 0x4125</li>
<li>&nbsp;The char() function: &nbsp;password LIKE CHAR(65,37)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;Multiple mixed queries: </b><br/>
MySQL library connectors do not support multiple queries separated by <b>';'</b>&nbsp;so there's no way to inject multiple non-homogeneous SQL commands inside a single SQL injection vulnerability like in Microsoft SQL Server. <br/>
<br/>
For example the following injection will result in an error: <br/>
&nbsp;1Â ; update tablename set code='javascript code' where 1 -- &nbsp; <br/>
