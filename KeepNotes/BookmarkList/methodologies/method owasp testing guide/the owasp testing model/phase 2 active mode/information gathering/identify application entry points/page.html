<title>Identify Application Entry Points</title>
</head><body><b>Summary</b><br/>
Enumerating the application and its attack surface is a key precursor before any thorough testing can be undertaken, as it allows the tester to identify likely areas of weakness. This section aims to help identify and map out areas within the application that should be investigated once enumeration and mapping have been completed.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Test Objectives</b><br/>
Understand how requests are formed and typical responses from the application<br/>
<br/>
<b>How to Test</b><br/>
Before any testing begins, the tester should always get a good under-standing of the application and how the user and browser communi-cates with it. As the tester walks through the application, they should pay &nbsp;special &nbsp;attention &nbsp;to &nbsp;all &nbsp;HTTP &nbsp;requests &nbsp;(GET &nbsp;and &nbsp;POST &nbsp;Methods, &nbsp;also known as Verbs), as well as every parameter and form field that is passed to the application. In addition, they should pay attention to when &nbsp;GET &nbsp;requests &nbsp;are &nbsp;used &nbsp;and &nbsp;when &nbsp;POST &nbsp;requests &nbsp;are &nbsp;used &nbsp;to &nbsp;pass &nbsp;parameters &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;application. &nbsp;It &nbsp;is &nbsp;very &nbsp;common &nbsp;that &nbsp;GET &nbsp;re-quests are used, but when sensitive information is passed, it is often done within the body of a POST request.<br/>
<br/>
Note that to see the parameters sent in a POST request, the tester will need to use a tool such as an intercepting proxy (for example, OWASP: Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)) or a browser plug-in. Within the POST request, the tester should also make special note of any hidden form fields that are being passed to the application, as these usually contain sensitive information, such as state information, quantity of items, the price of items, that the developer never intended for you to see or change.<br/>
<br/>
In the author’s experience, it has been very useful to use an intercept-ing &nbsp;proxy &nbsp;and &nbsp;a &nbsp;spreadsheet &nbsp;for &nbsp;this &nbsp;stage &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;testing. &nbsp;The &nbsp;proxy &nbsp;will keep track of every request and response between the tester and the &nbsp;application &nbsp;as &nbsp;they &nbsp;u &nbsp;walk &nbsp;through &nbsp;it. &nbsp;Additionally, &nbsp;at &nbsp;this &nbsp;point, &nbsp;testers &nbsp;usually &nbsp;trap &nbsp;every &nbsp;request &nbsp;and &nbsp;response &nbsp;so &nbsp;that &nbsp;they &nbsp;can &nbsp;see exactly every header, parameter, etc. that is being passed to the application &nbsp;and &nbsp;what &nbsp;is &nbsp;being &nbsp;returned. &nbsp;This &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;quite &nbsp;tedious &nbsp;at &nbsp;times, especially on large interactive sites (think of a banking applica-tion). However, experience will show what to look for and this phase can be significantly reduced.<br/>
<br/>
As &nbsp;the &nbsp;tester &nbsp;walks &nbsp;through &nbsp;the &nbsp;application, &nbsp;they &nbsp;should &nbsp;take &nbsp;note &nbsp;of &nbsp;any &nbsp;interesting &nbsp;parameters &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;URL, &nbsp;custom &nbsp;headers, &nbsp;or &nbsp;body &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;requests/responses, &nbsp;and &nbsp;save &nbsp;them &nbsp;in &nbsp;a &nbsp;spreadsheet. &nbsp;The &nbsp;spreadsheet should include the page requested (it might be good to also &nbsp;add &nbsp;the &nbsp;request &nbsp;number &nbsp;from &nbsp;the &nbsp;proxy, &nbsp;for &nbsp;future &nbsp;reference), &nbsp;the &nbsp;interesting &nbsp;parameters, &nbsp;the &nbsp;type &nbsp;of &nbsp;request &nbsp;(POST/GET), &nbsp;if &nbsp;access &nbsp;is &nbsp;authenticated/unauthenticated, &nbsp;if &nbsp;SSL &nbsp;is &nbsp;used, &nbsp;if &nbsp;it’s &nbsp;part &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;multi-step &nbsp;process, &nbsp;and &nbsp;any &nbsp;other &nbsp;relevant &nbsp;notes. &nbsp;Once &nbsp;they &nbsp;have &nbsp;every area of the application mapped out, then they can go through the &nbsp;application &nbsp;and &nbsp;test &nbsp;each &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;areas &nbsp;that &nbsp;they &nbsp;have &nbsp;identified &nbsp;and make notes for what worked and what didn’t work. The rest of this guide will identify how to test each of these areas of interest, but this section must be undertaken before any of the actual testing can commence.<br/>
<br/>
Below &nbsp;are &nbsp;some &nbsp;points &nbsp;of &nbsp;interests &nbsp;for &nbsp;all &nbsp;requests &nbsp;and &nbsp;responses. &nbsp;Within &nbsp;the &nbsp;requests &nbsp;section, &nbsp;focus &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;GET &nbsp;and &nbsp;POST &nbsp;methods, &nbsp;as these appear the majority of the requests. Note that other meth-ods, &nbsp;such &nbsp;as &nbsp;PUT &nbsp;and &nbsp;DELETE, &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;used. &nbsp;Often, &nbsp;these &nbsp;more &nbsp;rare &nbsp;requests, if allowed, can expose vulnerabilities. There is a special sec-tion in this guide dedicated for testing these HTTP methods.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Requests:</b><ul><li>Identify where GETs are used and where POSTs are used.</li>
<li>Identify all parameters used in a POST request (these are in the bodyof the request).</li>
<li>Within the POST request, pay special attention to any hiddenparameters. &nbsp;When &nbsp;a &nbsp;POST &nbsp;is &nbsp;sent &nbsp;all &nbsp;the &nbsp;form &nbsp;fields &nbsp;(including &nbsp;hidden parameters) will be sent in the body of the HTTP message to the application. These typically aren’t seen unless a proxy or view the HTML source code is used. In addition, the next page shown, its data, &nbsp;and &nbsp;the &nbsp;level &nbsp;of &nbsp;access &nbsp;can &nbsp;all &nbsp;be &nbsp;different &nbsp;depending &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;value of the hidden parameter(s).</li>
<li>Identify all parameters used in a GET request (i.e., URL), in particularthe query string (usually after a ? mark).</li>
<li>Identify all the parameters of the query string. These usually are in a pair format, such as foo=bar. Also note that many parameters can be in one query string such as separated by a &amp;, ~, :, or any other special character or encoding.</li>
<li>A special note when it comes to identifying multiple parametersin &nbsp;one &nbsp;string &nbsp;or &nbsp;within &nbsp;a &nbsp;POST &nbsp;request &nbsp;is &nbsp;that &nbsp;some &nbsp;or &nbsp;all &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;parameters will be needed to execute the attacks. The tester needs to identify all of the parameters (even if encoded or &nbsp; encrypted) &nbsp; and &nbsp; identify &nbsp; which &nbsp; ones &nbsp; are &nbsp; processed &nbsp; by &nbsp; the &nbsp; application. &nbsp;Later &nbsp;sections &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;guide &nbsp;will &nbsp;identify &nbsp;how &nbsp;to &nbsp;test &nbsp;these &nbsp;parameters. &nbsp;At &nbsp;this &nbsp;point, &nbsp;just &nbsp;make &nbsp;sure &nbsp;each &nbsp;one &nbsp;of &nbsp;them &nbsp;is identified.</li>
<li>Also pay attention to any additional or custom type headers nottypically seen (such as debug=False).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Responses:</b><br/>
Identify where new cookies are set (Set-Cookie header), modified, or added to.<br/>
Identify where there are any redirects (3xx HTTP status code), 400status codes, in particular 403 Forbidden, and 500 internal server errors during normal responses (i.e., unmodified requests). <br/>
Also note where any interesting headers are used. For example,“Server: BIG-IP” indicates that the site is load balanced. Thus, &nbsp;if &nbsp;a &nbsp;site &nbsp;is &nbsp;load &nbsp;balanced &nbsp;and &nbsp;one &nbsp;server &nbsp;is &nbsp;incorrectly &nbsp;configured, then the tester might have to make multiple requests to &nbsp;access &nbsp;the &nbsp;vulnerable &nbsp;server, &nbsp;depending &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;type &nbsp;of &nbsp;load &nbsp;balancing used.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Black Box Testing</b><br/>
Testing for application entry points:<br/>
The &nbsp;following &nbsp;are &nbsp;two &nbsp;examples &nbsp;on &nbsp;how &nbsp;to &nbsp;check &nbsp;for &nbsp;application &nbsp;entry points.<br/>
<br/>
EXAMPLE 1<br/>
This &nbsp;example &nbsp;shows &nbsp;a &nbsp;GET &nbsp;request &nbsp;that &nbsp;would &nbsp;purchase &nbsp;an &nbsp;item &nbsp;from an online shopping application.<br/>
GET &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; https://x.x.x.x/shoppingApp/buyme.asp?CUSTOME-RID=100&amp;ITEM=z101a&amp;PRICE=62.50&amp;IP=x.x.x.x <br/>
Host: x.x.x.x<br/>
Cookie: &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
SESSIONID=Z29vZCBqb2IgcGFkYXdhIG15IHVzZXJuY-W1lIGlzIGZvbyBhbmQgcGFzc3dvcmQgaXMgYmFy<br/>
<br/>
Result Expected:<br/>
Here the tester would note all the parameters of the request such as CUSTOMERID, ITEM, PRICE, IP, and the Cookie (which could just be encoded parameters or used for session state).<br/>
<br/>
EXAMPLE 2<br/>
This example shows a POST request that would log you into an application.<br/>
POST &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://x.x.x.x/KevinNotSoGoodApp/authenticate.asp?-service=login<br/>
Host: x.x.x.x<br/>
Cookie: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SESSIONID=dGhpcyBpcyBhIGJhZCBhcHAgdGhhdCB-zZXRzIHByZWRpY3RhYmxlIGNvb2tpZXMgYW5kIG1pbmUgaX-MgMTIzNA==<br/>
CustomCookie=00my00trusted00ip00is00x.x.x.x00<br/>
<br/>
Body of the POST message:<br/>
user=admin&amp;pass=pass123&amp;debug=true&amp;fromtrustIP=true<br/>
<br/>
Result Expected:<br/>
In &nbsp;this &nbsp;example &nbsp;the &nbsp;tester &nbsp;would &nbsp;note &nbsp;all &nbsp;the &nbsp;parameters &nbsp;as &nbsp;they &nbsp;have before but notice that the parameters are passed in the body of the message and not in the URL. Additionally, note that there is a custom cookie that is being used.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Gray Box Testing</b><br/>
Testing &nbsp;for &nbsp;application &nbsp;entry &nbsp;points &nbsp;via &nbsp;a &nbsp;Gray &nbsp;Box &nbsp;methodology &nbsp;would consist of everything already identified above with one addi-tion. In cases where there are external sources from which the ap-plication receives data and processes it (such as SNMP traps, syslog messages, SMTP, or SOAP messages from other servers) a meeting with &nbsp;the &nbsp;application &nbsp;developers &nbsp;could &nbsp;identify &nbsp;any &nbsp;functions &nbsp;that &nbsp;would accept or expect user input and how they are formatted. For example, the developer could help in understanding how to formu-late a correct SOAP request that the application would accept and where the web service resides (if the web service or any other func-tion hasn’t already been identified during the black box testing).<br/>
