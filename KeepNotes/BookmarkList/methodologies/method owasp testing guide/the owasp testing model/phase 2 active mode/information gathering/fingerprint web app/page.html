<title>Fingerprint Web App</title>
</head><body><b>Summary</b><br/>
There is nothing new under the sun, and nearly every web applica-tion that one may think of developing has already been developed. With the vast number of free and open source software projects that &nbsp;are &nbsp;actively &nbsp;developed &nbsp;and &nbsp;deployed &nbsp;around &nbsp;the &nbsp;world, &nbsp;it &nbsp;is &nbsp;very &nbsp;likely &nbsp;that &nbsp;an &nbsp;application &nbsp;security &nbsp;test &nbsp;will &nbsp;face &nbsp;a &nbsp;target &nbsp;site that is entirely or partly dependent on these well known applica-tions &nbsp;(e.g. &nbsp;Wordpress, &nbsp;phpBB, &nbsp;Mediawiki, &nbsp;etc). &nbsp;Knowing &nbsp;the &nbsp;web &nbsp;application &nbsp;components &nbsp;that &nbsp;are &nbsp;being &nbsp;tested &nbsp;significantly &nbsp;helps &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;testing &nbsp;process &nbsp;and &nbsp;will &nbsp;also &nbsp;drastically &nbsp;reduce &nbsp;the &nbsp;effort &nbsp;required during the test. These well known web applications have known HTML headers, cookies, and directory structures that can be enumerated to identify the application.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Test Objectives</b><br/>
Identify the web application and version to determine known vul-nerabilities and the appropriate exploits to use during testing.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How to Test<br/>
</b><b>Cookies</b><br/>
A relatively reliable way to identify a web application is by the ap-plication-specific cookies.<br/>
<br/>
Consider the following HTTP-request:<br/>
GET / HTTP/1.1<br/>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:31.0)Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0<br/>
Accept: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xm-l;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8<br/>
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5‘’’<br/>
Cookie: &nbsp; &nbsp; wp-settings-time-1=1406093286; &nbsp; &nbsp; wp-settings-time-2=1405988284’’’<br/>
DNT: 1<br/>
Connection: keep-aliveHost: blog.owasp.org<br/>
<br/>
The cookie CAKEPHP has automatically been set, which gives in-formation about the framework being used. List of common cook-ies names is presented in Cpmmon Application Identifiers section. However, it is possible to change the name of the cookie.<br/>
<br/>
HTML source code<br/>
This &nbsp;technique &nbsp;is &nbsp;based &nbsp;on &nbsp;finding &nbsp;certain &nbsp;patterns &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;HTML &nbsp;page &nbsp;source &nbsp;code. &nbsp;Often &nbsp;one &nbsp;can &nbsp;find &nbsp;a &nbsp;lot &nbsp;of &nbsp;information &nbsp;which &nbsp;helps a tester to recognize a specific web application. One of the common &nbsp;markers &nbsp;are &nbsp;HTML &nbsp;comments &nbsp;that &nbsp;directly &nbsp;lead &nbsp;to &nbsp;ap-plication disclosure. More often certain application-specific paths can be found, i.e. links to application-specific css and/or js folders. Finally, &nbsp;specific &nbsp;script &nbsp;variables &nbsp;might &nbsp;also &nbsp;point &nbsp;to &nbsp;a &nbsp;certain &nbsp;ap-plication.From &nbsp;the &nbsp;meta &nbsp;tag &nbsp;below, &nbsp;one &nbsp;can &nbsp;easily &nbsp;learn &nbsp;the &nbsp;application &nbsp;used &nbsp;by &nbsp;a &nbsp;website &nbsp;and &nbsp;its &nbsp;version. &nbsp;The &nbsp;comment, &nbsp;specific &nbsp;paths &nbsp;and script variables can all help an attacker to quickly determine an instance of an application.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;meta name=”generator” content=”WordPress 3.9.2” /&gt;<br/>
<br/>
More &nbsp;frequently &nbsp;such &nbsp;information &nbsp;is &nbsp;placed &nbsp;between &nbsp;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; &nbsp;tags, &nbsp;in &nbsp;&lt;meta&gt; &nbsp;tags &nbsp;or &nbsp;at &nbsp;the &nbsp;end &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;page. &nbsp;Nevertheless, it is recommended to check the whole document since it can be useful &nbsp;for &nbsp;other &nbsp;purposes &nbsp;such &nbsp;as &nbsp;inspection &nbsp;of &nbsp;other &nbsp;useful &nbsp;com-ments and hidden fields.<br/>
<br/>
Specific files and folders<br/>
Apart from information gathered from HTML sources, there is an-other &nbsp;approach &nbsp;which &nbsp;greatly &nbsp;helps &nbsp;an &nbsp;attacker &nbsp;to &nbsp;determine &nbsp;the &nbsp;application &nbsp;with &nbsp;high &nbsp;accuracy. &nbsp;Every &nbsp;application &nbsp;has &nbsp;its &nbsp;own &nbsp;spe-cific file and folder structure on the server. It has been pointed out that one can see the specific path from the HTML page source but sometimes &nbsp;they &nbsp;are &nbsp;not &nbsp;explicitly &nbsp;presented &nbsp;there &nbsp;and &nbsp;still &nbsp;reside &nbsp;on the server.<br/>
<br/>
In order to uncover them a technique known as dirbusting is used. Dirbusting is brute forcing a target with predictable folder and file names &nbsp;and &nbsp;monitoring &nbsp;HTTP-responses &nbsp;to &nbsp;emumerate &nbsp;server &nbsp;contents. &nbsp;This &nbsp;information &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;used &nbsp;both &nbsp;for &nbsp;finding &nbsp;default &nbsp;files &nbsp;and &nbsp;attacking &nbsp;them, &nbsp;and &nbsp;for &nbsp;fingerprinting &nbsp;the &nbsp;web &nbsp;application. &nbsp;Dirbusting &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;done &nbsp;in &nbsp;several &nbsp;ways, &nbsp;the &nbsp;example &nbsp;below &nbsp;shows &nbsp;a &nbsp;successful &nbsp;dirbusting &nbsp;attack &nbsp;against &nbsp;a &nbsp;WordPress powered target with the help of defined list and intruder functionality of Burp Suite.<br/>
<br/>
We &nbsp;can &nbsp;see &nbsp;that &nbsp;for &nbsp;some &nbsp;WordPress-specific &nbsp;folders &nbsp;(for &nbsp;in-stance, /wp-includes/, /wp-admin/ and /wp-content/) HTTP-re-ponses are 403 (Forbidden), 302 (Found, redirection to wp-login.php) &nbsp;and &nbsp;200 &nbsp;(OK) &nbsp;respectively. &nbsp;This &nbsp;is &nbsp;a &nbsp;good &nbsp;indicator &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;target is WordPress-powered. The same way it is possible to dir-bust &nbsp;different &nbsp;application &nbsp;plugin &nbsp;folders &nbsp;and &nbsp;their &nbsp;versions. &nbsp;On &nbsp;the screenshot below one can see a typical CHANGELOG file of a Drupal plugin, which provides information on the application being used and discloses a vulnerable plugin version.<br/>
<br/>
Tip: before starting dirbusting, it is recommended to check the ro-bots.txt &nbsp;file &nbsp;first. &nbsp;Sometimes &nbsp;application &nbsp;specific &nbsp;folders &nbsp;and &nbsp;other &nbsp;sensitive &nbsp;information &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;found &nbsp;there &nbsp;as &nbsp;well. &nbsp;An &nbsp;example &nbsp;of &nbsp;such a robots.txt file is presented on a screenshot below.<br/>
<br/>
Specific files and folders are different for each specific application. It &nbsp;is &nbsp;recommended &nbsp;to &nbsp;install &nbsp;the &nbsp;corresponding &nbsp;application &nbsp;during &nbsp;penetration tests in order to have better understanding of what in-frastructure is presented and what files might be left on the server. However, several good file lists already exist and one good example is FuzzDB wordlists of predictable files/folders (http://code.google.com/p/fuzzdb/).<br/>

Tools<br/>
A &nbsp;list &nbsp;of &nbsp;general &nbsp;and &nbsp;well-known &nbsp;tools &nbsp;is &nbsp;presented &nbsp;below. &nbsp;There &nbsp;are also a lot of other utilities, as well as framework-based finger-printing tools.<br/>
<br/>
WhatWeb<br/>
Website: http://www.morningstarsecurity.com/research/whatweb<br/>
Currently one of the best fingerprinting tools on the market. Includ-ed in a default Kali Linux build. Language: Ruby Matches for finger-printing are made with:<br/>
Text strings (case sensitive)<br/>
Regular expressions<br/>
Google Hack Database queries (limited set of keywords)<br/>
MD5 hashes<br/>
URL recognition<br/>
HTML tag patterns<br/>
Custom ruby code for passive and aggressive operations<br/>
<br/>
BlindElephant<br/>
Website: https://community.qualys.com/community/blindelephantThis &nbsp;great &nbsp;tool &nbsp;works &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;principle &nbsp;of &nbsp;static &nbsp;file &nbsp;checksum &nbsp;based &nbsp;version difference thus providing a very high quality of fingerprinting. Language: Python<br/>

Wappalyzer<br/>
Website: http://wappalyzer.com<br/>
Wapplyzer &nbsp;is &nbsp;a &nbsp;Firefox &nbsp;Chrome &nbsp;plug-in. &nbsp;It &nbsp;works &nbsp;only &nbsp;on &nbsp;regular &nbsp;ex-pression matching and doesn’t need anything other than the page to be &nbsp;loaded &nbsp;on &nbsp;browser. &nbsp;It &nbsp;works &nbsp;completely &nbsp;at &nbsp;the &nbsp;browser &nbsp;level &nbsp;and &nbsp;gives &nbsp;results &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;form &nbsp;of &nbsp;icons. &nbsp;Although &nbsp;sometimes &nbsp;it &nbsp;has &nbsp;false &nbsp;positives, this is very handy to have notion of what technologies were used to construct a target website immediately after browsing a page.<br/>
<br/>
Sample output of a plug-in is presented on a screenshot below.<br/>

Remediation<br/>
The general advice is to use several of the tools described above and check logs to better understand what exactly helps an attacker to dis-close the web framework. By performing multiple scans after changes have &nbsp;been &nbsp;made &nbsp;to &nbsp;hide &nbsp;framework &nbsp;tracks, &nbsp;it’s &nbsp;possible &nbsp;to &nbsp;achieve &nbsp;a &nbsp;better level of security and to make sure of the framework can not be detected by automatic scans. Below are some specific recommenda-tions &nbsp;by &nbsp;framework &nbsp;marker &nbsp;location &nbsp;and &nbsp;some &nbsp;additional &nbsp;interesting &nbsp;approaches.<br/>
<br/>
HTTP headers<br/>
Check &nbsp;the &nbsp;configuration &nbsp;and &nbsp;disable &nbsp;or &nbsp;obfuscate &nbsp;all &nbsp;HTTP-headers &nbsp;that &nbsp;disclose &nbsp;information &nbsp;the &nbsp;technologies &nbsp;used. &nbsp;Here &nbsp;is &nbsp;an &nbsp;interest-ing &nbsp;article &nbsp;about &nbsp;HTTP-headers &nbsp;obfuscation &nbsp;using &nbsp;Netscaler: &nbsp;http://grahamhosking.blogspot.ru/2013/07/obfuscating-http-header-us-ing-netscaler.html<br/>
<br/>
Cookies<br/>
It is recommended to change cookie names by making changes in the corresponding configuration files.<br/>
<br/>
HTML source code<br/>
Manually &nbsp;check &nbsp;the &nbsp;contents &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;HTML &nbsp;code &nbsp;and &nbsp;remove &nbsp;every-thing that explicitly points to the framework.<br/>
<br/>
General guidelines:<br/>
Make sure there are no visual markers disclosing the framework<br/>
Remove any unnecessary comments (copyrights, bug information, specific framework comments)<br/>
Remove META and generator tags<br/>
Use the companies own css or js files and do not store those in a framework-specific folders<br/>
Do not use default scripts on the page or obfuscate them if they must be used.<br/>
<br/>
Specific files and folders<br/>
General guidelines:<br/>
Remove any unnecessary or unused files on the server. This implies text files disclosing information about versions and installation too.<br/>
Restrict access to other files in order to achieve 404-response when accessing them from outside. This can be done, for example, by mod-ifying htaccess file and adding RewriteCond or RewriteRule there. An example of such restriction for two common WordPress folders is pre-sented below.<br/>
<br/>
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /wp-login\.php$ [OR]RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /wp-admin/$<br/>
RewriteRule $ /http://your_website [R=404,L]<br/>
<br/>
However, &nbsp;these &nbsp;are &nbsp;not &nbsp;the &nbsp;only &nbsp;ways &nbsp;to &nbsp;restrict &nbsp;access. &nbsp;In &nbsp;order &nbsp;to &nbsp;automate this process, certain framework-specific plugins exist. One example for WordPress is StealthLogin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/stealth-login-page)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Additional approaches<br/>
General guidelines:<br/>
[1] Checksum management<br/>
The &nbsp;purpose &nbsp;of &nbsp;this &nbsp;approach &nbsp;is &nbsp;to &nbsp;beat &nbsp;checksum-based &nbsp;scanners &nbsp;and not let them disclose files by their hashes. Generally, there are two approaches in checksum management:<br/>
Change the location of where those files are placed (i.e. move them to another folder, or rename the existing folder)<br/>
Modify the contents - even slight modification results in a completely &nbsp;different &nbsp;hash &nbsp;sum, &nbsp;so &nbsp;adding &nbsp;a &nbsp;single &nbsp;byte &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;end &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;file &nbsp;should not be a big problem.<br/>
<br/>
[2] Controlled chaos<br/>
A &nbsp;funny &nbsp;and &nbsp;effective &nbsp;method &nbsp;that &nbsp;involves &nbsp;adding &nbsp;bogus &nbsp;files &nbsp;and &nbsp;folders from other frameworks in order to fool scanners and confuse an &nbsp;attacker. &nbsp;But &nbsp;be &nbsp;careful &nbsp;not &nbsp;to &nbsp;overwrite &nbsp;existing &nbsp;files &nbsp;and &nbsp;folders &nbsp;and to break the current framework! <br/>
