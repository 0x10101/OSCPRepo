<title>Map Execution Paths Through App</title>
</head><body><b>Summary</b><br/>
Before &nbsp;commencing &nbsp;security &nbsp;testing, &nbsp;understanding &nbsp;the &nbsp;structure &nbsp;of the application is paramount. Without a thorough understanding of &nbsp;the &nbsp;layout &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;application, &nbsp;it &nbsp;is &nbsp;unlkely &nbsp;that &nbsp;it &nbsp;will &nbsp;be &nbsp;tested &nbsp;thoroughly.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Test Objectives</b><br/>
Map the target application and understand the principal workflows.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How to Test</b><br/>
In &nbsp;black &nbsp;box &nbsp;testing &nbsp;it &nbsp;is &nbsp;extremely &nbsp;difficult &nbsp;to &nbsp;test &nbsp;the &nbsp;entire &nbsp;code &nbsp;base. &nbsp;Not &nbsp;just &nbsp;because &nbsp;the &nbsp;tester &nbsp;has &nbsp;no &nbsp;view &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;code &nbsp;paths &nbsp;through the application, but even if they did, to test all code paths would be very time consuming. One way to reconcile this is to doc-ument what code paths were discovered and tested.<br/>
<br/>
There are several ways to approach the testing and measurement of code coverage:<br/>
Path - test each of the paths through an application that includescombinatorial &nbsp; and &nbsp; boundary &nbsp; value &nbsp; analysis &nbsp; testing &nbsp; for &nbsp; each &nbsp; decision &nbsp; path. &nbsp; While &nbsp; this &nbsp; approach &nbsp; offers &nbsp; thoroughness, &nbsp; the &nbsp; number of testable paths grows exponentially with each decision branch.<br/>
Data flow (or taint analysis) - tests the assignment of variables via external &nbsp;interaction &nbsp;(normally &nbsp;users). &nbsp;Focuses &nbsp;on &nbsp;mapping &nbsp;the flow, transformation and use of data throughout an application.<br/>
Race - tests multiple concurrent instances of the application manipulating the same data.<br/>
<br/>
The trade off as to what method is used and to what degree each method &nbsp;is &nbsp;used &nbsp;should &nbsp;be &nbsp;negotiated &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;application &nbsp;owner. &nbsp;Simpler approaches could also be adopted, including asking the ap-plication owner what functions or code sections they are particular-ly concerned about and how those code segments can be reached.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Black Box Testing</b><br/>
To demonstrate code coverage to the application owner, the tester can start with a spreadsheet and document all the links discovered by spidering the application (either manually or automatically). Then the tester can look more closely at decision points in the application and &nbsp;investigate &nbsp;how &nbsp;many &nbsp;significant &nbsp;code &nbsp;paths &nbsp;are &nbsp;discovered. &nbsp;These &nbsp;should &nbsp;then &nbsp;be &nbsp;documented &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;spreadsheet &nbsp;with &nbsp;URLs, &nbsp;prose and screenshot descriptions of the paths discovered.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Gray/White Box testing</b><br/>
Ensuring &nbsp;sufficient &nbsp;code &nbsp;coverage &nbsp;for &nbsp;the &nbsp;application &nbsp;owner &nbsp;is &nbsp;far &nbsp;easier with the gray and white box approach to testing. Information solicited by and provided to the tester will ensure the minimum re-quirements for code coverage are met.<br/>
<br/>
Example<br/>
Automatic Spidering<br/>
The &nbsp;automatic &nbsp;spider &nbsp;is &nbsp;a &nbsp;tool &nbsp;used &nbsp;to &nbsp;automatically &nbsp;discover &nbsp;new &nbsp;resources &nbsp;(URLs) &nbsp;on &nbsp;a &nbsp;particular &nbsp;website. &nbsp;It &nbsp;begins &nbsp;with &nbsp;a &nbsp;list &nbsp;of &nbsp;URLs to visit, called the seeds, which depends on how the Spider is started. While there are a lot of Spidering tools, the following example uses the Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP).<br/>
<br/>
ZAP offers the following automatic spidering features, which can be selected based on the tester’s needs:<br/>
Spider Site - The seed list contains all the existing URIs already found for the selected site.<br/>
Spider Subtree - The seed list contains all the existing URIs already found and present in the subtree of the selected node.<br/>
Spider URL - The seed list contains only the URI corresponding to the selected node (in the Site Tree).<br/>
Spider all in Scope - The seed list contains all the URIs the user has selected as being ‘In Scope’.<br/>
