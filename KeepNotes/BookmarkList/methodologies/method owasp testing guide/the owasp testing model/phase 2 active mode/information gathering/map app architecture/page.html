<title>Map App Architecture</title>
</head><body><b>Summary</b><br/>
The complexity of interconnected and heterogeneous web server in-frastructure can include hundreds of web applications and makes con-figuration management and review a fundamental step in testing and deploying every single application. In fact it takes only a single vulner-ability to undermine the security of the entire infrastructure, and even small &nbsp;and &nbsp;seemingly &nbsp;unimportant &nbsp;problems &nbsp;may &nbsp;evolve &nbsp;into &nbsp;severe &nbsp;risks for another application on the same server.<br/>
<br/>
To address these problems, it is of utmost importance to perform an in-depth &nbsp;review &nbsp;of &nbsp;configuration &nbsp;and &nbsp;known &nbsp;security &nbsp;issues. &nbsp;Before &nbsp;performing an in-depth review it is necessary to map the network and application architecture. The different elements that make up the in-frastructure need to be determined to understand how they interact with a web application and how they affect security.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How to Test<br/>
</b><b>Map the application architecture</b><br/>
<br/>
The &nbsp;application &nbsp;architecture &nbsp;needs &nbsp;to &nbsp;be &nbsp;mapped &nbsp;through &nbsp;some &nbsp;test &nbsp;to &nbsp;determine &nbsp;what &nbsp;different &nbsp;components &nbsp;are &nbsp;used &nbsp;to &nbsp;build &nbsp;the &nbsp;web &nbsp;application. In small setups, such as a simple CGI-based application, a single server might be used that runs the web server which executes the C, Perl, or Shell CGIs application, and perhaps also the authentication mechanism.<br/>
<br/>
On &nbsp;more &nbsp;complex &nbsp;setups, &nbsp;such &nbsp;as &nbsp;an &nbsp;online &nbsp;bank &nbsp;system, &nbsp;multiple &nbsp;servers might be involved. These may include a reverse proxy, a front-end web server, an application server and a database server or LDAP server. &nbsp;Each &nbsp;of &nbsp;these &nbsp;servers &nbsp;will &nbsp;be &nbsp;used &nbsp;for &nbsp;different &nbsp;purposes &nbsp;and &nbsp;might be even be divided in different networks with firewalls between them. &nbsp;This &nbsp;creates &nbsp;different &nbsp;DMZs &nbsp;so &nbsp;that &nbsp;access &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;web &nbsp;server &nbsp;will not grant a remote user access to the authentication mechanism itself, and so that compromises of the different elements of the archi-tecture &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;isolated &nbsp;so &nbsp;that &nbsp;they &nbsp;will &nbsp;not &nbsp;compromise &nbsp;the &nbsp;whole &nbsp;architecture.<br/>
<br/>
Getting &nbsp;knowledge &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;application &nbsp;architecture &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;easy &nbsp;if &nbsp;this &nbsp;information is provided to the testing team by the application devel-opers in document form or through interviews, but can also prove to be very difficult if doing a blind penetration test.<br/>
<br/>
In &nbsp;the &nbsp;latter &nbsp;case, &nbsp;a &nbsp;tester &nbsp;will &nbsp;first &nbsp;start &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;assumption &nbsp;that &nbsp;there is a simple setup (a single server). Then they will retrieve information &nbsp;from &nbsp;other &nbsp;tests &nbsp;and &nbsp;derive &nbsp;the &nbsp;different &nbsp;elements, &nbsp;question &nbsp;this assumption and extend the architecture map. The tester will start by asking simple questions such as: “Is there a firewalling system pro-tecting the web server?”. This question will be answered based on the results &nbsp;of &nbsp;network &nbsp;scans &nbsp;targeted &nbsp;at &nbsp;the &nbsp;web &nbsp;server &nbsp;and &nbsp;the &nbsp;analy-sis of whether the network ports of the web server are being filtered in &nbsp;the &nbsp;network &nbsp;edge &nbsp;(no &nbsp;answer &nbsp;or &nbsp;ICMP &nbsp;unreachables &nbsp;are &nbsp;received) &nbsp;or &nbsp;if &nbsp;the &nbsp;server &nbsp;is &nbsp;directly &nbsp;connected &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;Internet &nbsp;(i.e. &nbsp;returns &nbsp;RST &nbsp;packets for all non-listening ports). This analysis can be enhanced to determine &nbsp;the &nbsp;type &nbsp;of &nbsp;firewall &nbsp;used &nbsp;based &nbsp;on &nbsp;network &nbsp;packet &nbsp;tests. &nbsp;Is it a stateful firewall or is it an access list filter on a router? How is it configured? Can it be bypassed?<br/>
<br/>
Detecting a reverse proxy in front of the web server needs to be done by the analysis of the web server banner, which might directly disclose the &nbsp;existence &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;reverse &nbsp;proxy &nbsp;(for &nbsp;example, &nbsp;if &nbsp;‘WebSEAL’[1] &nbsp;is &nbsp;re-turned). It can also be determined by obtaining the answers given by the web server to requests and comparing them to the expected an-swers. For example, some reverse proxies act as “intrusion prevention systems” (or web-shields) by blocking known attacks targeted at the web server. If the web server is known to answer with a 404 message to a request that targets an unavailable page and returns a different error message for some common web attacks like those done by CGI scanners, &nbsp;it &nbsp;might &nbsp;be &nbsp;an &nbsp;indication &nbsp;of &nbsp;a &nbsp;reverse &nbsp;proxy &nbsp;(or &nbsp;an &nbsp;applica-tion-level &nbsp;firewall) &nbsp;which &nbsp;is &nbsp;filtering &nbsp;the &nbsp;requests &nbsp;and &nbsp;returning &nbsp;a &nbsp;dif-ferent error page than the one expected. Another example: if the web server returns a set of available HTTP methods (including TRACE) but the expected methods return errors then there is probably something in between blocking them.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases, even the protection system gives itself away:<br/>
GET /web-console/ServerInfo.jsp%00 HTTP/1.0<br/>
HTTP/1.0 200<br/>
Pragma: no-cache<br/>
Cache-Control: no-cache<br/>
Content-Type: text/html<br/>
Content-Length: 83<br/>
<br/>
&lt;TITLE&gt;Error&lt;/TITLE&gt;<br/>
&lt;BODY&gt;<br/>
&lt;H1&gt;Error&lt;/H1&gt;FW-1 at XXXXXX: Access denied.&lt;/BODY&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Reverse &nbsp;proxies &nbsp;can &nbsp;also &nbsp;be &nbsp;introduced &nbsp;as &nbsp;proxy-caches &nbsp;to &nbsp;acceler-ate the performance of back-end application servers. Detecting these proxies &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;done &nbsp;based &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;server &nbsp;header. &nbsp;They &nbsp;can &nbsp;also &nbsp;be &nbsp;detected by timing requests that should be cached by the server and comparing the time taken to server the first request with subsequent requests.<br/>
<br/>
Another &nbsp;element &nbsp;that &nbsp;can &nbsp;be &nbsp;detected &nbsp;is &nbsp;network &nbsp;load &nbsp;balancers. &nbsp;Typically, &nbsp;these &nbsp;systems &nbsp;will &nbsp;balance &nbsp;a &nbsp;given &nbsp;TCP/IP &nbsp;port &nbsp;to &nbsp;multiple &nbsp;servers based on different algorithms (round-robin, web server load, number of requests, etc.). Thus, the detection of this architecture ele-ment needs to be done by examining multiple requests and compar-ing results to determine if the requests are going to the same or differ-ent web servers. For example, based on the Date header if the server clocks are not synchronized. In some cases, the network load balance process might inject new information in the headers that will make it stand out distinctively, like the AlteonP cookie introduced by Nortel’s Alteon WebSystems load balancer.<br/>
<br/>
Application &nbsp;web &nbsp;servers &nbsp;are &nbsp;usually &nbsp;easy &nbsp;to &nbsp;detect. &nbsp;The &nbsp;request &nbsp;for &nbsp;several &nbsp;resources &nbsp;is &nbsp;handled &nbsp;by &nbsp;the &nbsp;application &nbsp;server &nbsp;itself &nbsp;(not &nbsp;the &nbsp;web server) and the response header will vary significantly (including different &nbsp;or &nbsp;additional &nbsp;values &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;answer &nbsp;header). &nbsp;Another &nbsp;way &nbsp;to &nbsp;detect these is to see if the web server tries to set cookies which are indicative of an application web server being used (such as the JSES-SIONID provided by some J2EE servers), or to rewrite URLs automati-cally to do session tracking.<br/>
<br/>
Authentication &nbsp;back &nbsp;ends &nbsp;(such &nbsp;as &nbsp;LDAP &nbsp;directories, &nbsp;relational &nbsp;data-bases, or RADIUS servers) however, are not as easy to detect from an external point of view in an immediate way, since they will be hidden by the application itself.<br/>
<br/>
The use of a back end database can be determined simply by navigat-ing an application. If there is highly dynamic content generated “on the fly,” it is probably being extracted from some sort of database by the application itself. Sometimes the way information is requested might give insight to the existence of a database back-end. For example, an online &nbsp;shopping &nbsp;application &nbsp;that &nbsp;uses &nbsp;numeric &nbsp;identifiers &nbsp;(‘id’) &nbsp;when &nbsp;browsing &nbsp;the &nbsp;different &nbsp;articles &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;shop. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;when &nbsp;doing &nbsp;a &nbsp;blind application test, knowledge of the underlying database is usually only available when a vulnerability surfaces in the application, such as poor exception handling or susceptibility to SQL injection.<br/>
