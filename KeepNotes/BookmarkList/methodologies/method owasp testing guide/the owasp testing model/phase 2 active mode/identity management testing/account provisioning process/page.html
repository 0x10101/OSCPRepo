<title>Account Provisioning Process</title>
</head><body><b>Summary</b>&nbsp;<br/>
The provisioning of accounts presents an opportunity for an attacker to create a valid account without application of the proper identification and authorization process. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;Test objectives </b><br/>
Verify which accounts may provision other accounts and of what type. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>&nbsp;How to test </b><br/>
Determine which roles are able to provision users and what sort of accounts they can provision. <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Is there any verification, vetting and authorization of provisioning requests?</li>
<li>&nbsp;Is there any verification, vetting and authorization of de-provisioning requests?</li>
<li>&nbsp;Can an administrator provision other administrators or just users? </li>
<li>&nbsp;Can an administrator or other user provision accounts with privileges greater than their own?</li>
<li>&nbsp;Can an administrator or user de-provision themselves?</li>
<li>&nbsp;How are the files or resources owned by the de-provisioned user managed? Are they deleted? Is access transferred?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
&nbsp;Example <br/>
In WordPress, only a user's name and email address are required to provision the user, as shown below: <br/>
De-provisioning of users requires the administrator to select the users to be de-provisioned, select Delete from the dropdown menu (circled) and then applying this action. The administrator is then presented with a dialog box asking what to do with the user's posts (delete or transfer them). &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Tools</b>&nbsp;<br/>
While the most thorough and accurate approach to completing this test is to conduct it manually, HTTP proxy tools could be also useful. <br/>
