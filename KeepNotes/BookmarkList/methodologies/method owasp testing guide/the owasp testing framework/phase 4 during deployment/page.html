<br/>
Phase 4.1: Application Penetration Testing<br/>
Having &nbsp;tested &nbsp;the &nbsp;requirements, &nbsp;analyzed &nbsp;the &nbsp;design, &nbsp;and &nbsp;per-formed code review, it might be assumed that all issues have been caught. &nbsp;Hopefully &nbsp;this &nbsp;is &nbsp;the &nbsp;case, &nbsp;but &nbsp;penetration &nbsp;testing &nbsp;the &nbsp;ap-plication after it has been deployed provides a last check to ensure that nothing has been missed.<br/>
<br/>
Phase 4.2: Configuration Management Testing<br/>
The application penetration test should include the checking of how the infrastructure was deployed and secured. While the application may be secure, a small aspect of the configuration could still be at a default install stage and vulnerable to exploitation.</body></html>
