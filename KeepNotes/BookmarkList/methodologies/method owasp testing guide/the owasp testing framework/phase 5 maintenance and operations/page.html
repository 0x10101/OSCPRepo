<br/>
<b>Phase 5.1: Conduct Operational Management Reviews</b><br/>
There &nbsp;needs &nbsp;to &nbsp;be &nbsp;a &nbsp;process &nbsp;in &nbsp;place &nbsp;which &nbsp;details &nbsp;how &nbsp;the &nbsp;oper-ational side of both the application and infrastructure is managed.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Phase 5.2: Conduct Periodic Health Checks</b><br/>
Monthly &nbsp;or &nbsp;quarterly &nbsp;health &nbsp;checks &nbsp;should &nbsp;be &nbsp;performed &nbsp;on &nbsp;both &nbsp;the &nbsp;application &nbsp;and &nbsp;infrastructure &nbsp;to &nbsp;ensure &nbsp;no &nbsp;new &nbsp;security &nbsp;risks &nbsp;have been introduced and that the level of security is still intact.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Phase 5.3: Ensure Change Verification</b><br/>
After &nbsp;every &nbsp;change &nbsp;has &nbsp;been &nbsp;approved &nbsp;and &nbsp;tested &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;QA &nbsp;envi-ronment &nbsp;and &nbsp;deployed &nbsp;into &nbsp;the &nbsp;production &nbsp;environment, &nbsp;it &nbsp;is &nbsp;vital &nbsp;that the change is checked to ensure that the level of security has not been affected by the change. This should be integrated into the change management process.</body></html>
