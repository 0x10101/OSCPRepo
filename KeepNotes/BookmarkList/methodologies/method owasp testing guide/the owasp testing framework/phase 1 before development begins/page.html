<title>Phase 1: Before Development Begins</title>
</head><body><b>Phase 1: Before Development Begins</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Phase 1.1: Define a SDLC</b><br/>
Before application development starts an adequate SDLC must be defined where security is inherent at each stage.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Phase 1.2: Review Policies and Standards</b><br/>
Ensure that there are appropriate policies, standards, and documen-tation in place. Documentation is extremely important as it gives de-velopment teams guidelines and policies that they can follow.<br/>
<br/>
People can only do the right thing if they know what the right thing is.<br/>
<br/>
If the application is to be developed in Java, it is essential that there is a Java secure coding standard. If the application is to use cryptog-raphy, it is essential that there is a cryptography standard. No pol-icies &nbsp;or &nbsp;standards &nbsp;can &nbsp;cover &nbsp;every &nbsp;situation &nbsp;that &nbsp;the &nbsp;development &nbsp;team will face. By documenting the common and predictable issues, there will be fewer decisions that need to be made during the de-velopment process.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Phase 1.3: Develop Measurement and Metrics Criteria and Ensure Traceability</b><br/>
Before &nbsp;development &nbsp;begins, &nbsp;plan &nbsp;the &nbsp;measurement &nbsp;program. &nbsp;By &nbsp;defining criteria that need to be measured, it provides visibility into defects &nbsp;in &nbsp;both &nbsp;the &nbsp;process &nbsp;and &nbsp;product. &nbsp;It &nbsp;is &nbsp;essential &nbsp;to &nbsp;define &nbsp;the metrics before development begins, as there may be a need to modify the process in order to capture the data.</body></html>
