<title>JS Obfuscation in Phishing Campaigns</title>
</head><body>https://www.proofpoint.com/sites/default/files/proofpoint-obfuscation-techniques-phishing-attacks-threat-insight-en-v1.pdf<br/>
<br/>
As phishing schemes become more sophisticated, the landing pages to which users are directed via email or social media lures are increasingly obfuscated to avoid detection by endpoints and gateway appliances. With few exceptions, these landing pages are legitimate-looking copies of the sites indicated in the lures, e.g., Dropbox, DHL, or Apple.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, though, while many of the obfuscation techniques we have examined here are extremely sophisticated, they are often being incorporated in phishing kits, meaning that even inexperienced cybercriminals can now stage attacks and build landing pages with commodity tools.<br/>
<br/>
For businesses, individuals, and vendors, the challenge is to implement detection techniques that can decode the obfuscation as well as to increase awareness of the warning signs for phishing campaigns</body></html>
