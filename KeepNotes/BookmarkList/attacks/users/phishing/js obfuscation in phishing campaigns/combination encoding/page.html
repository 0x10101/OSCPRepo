starts with the data URI method (Fig. 15)<br/>

Upon base64 decoding this we are presented with some a hex-encoded string<br/>

<br/>
Upon escaping the hex characters we are presented with the flipped base64 encoding method.<br/>

Upon flipping and base64 decoding, we are presented with a nested dean edwards JavaScript packer. This packer is very popular and easily decoded. Websites like http://jsbeautifier.org/ or tools like JSDetox (http://www.relentless-coding.org/projects/jsdetox) have no problem decoding it<br/>

After the second round of unpacking, the code is starting to emerge:<br/>
The last step to make it readable is to decode the URL encoding. Finally, we have the normalized phishing landing page<br/>
