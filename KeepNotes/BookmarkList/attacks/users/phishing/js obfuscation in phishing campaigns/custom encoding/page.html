<title>Custom Encoding</title>
</head><body>Another phishing landing obfuscation technique to discuss here is a custom character replacement that Proofpoint <br/>
researchers observed associated with an Apple Account phishing scheme. Initially we are presented with a page that <br/>
consists of two eval statements and two arrays at the end of the second eval statement. Looking closely at the array, it <br/>
appears that it could be useful in decoding.<br/>

<br/>
If we decode the first eval statement we observe that the JavaScript “unescape” variable is rewritten, so that when the <br/>
second section evals the code, it runs the “new unescape” rather than the normal JavaScript unescape command. <br/>
The first variable in the function is the code to deobfuscate, the second is the encoded characters, and the third is the <br/>
key. If the variables were rewritten to make more sense, the code would look something like this.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This is simply a character replace using a cipher that looks something like this:<br/>

<br/>
When we replace these characters on the page, we are presented with a mostly-decoded page:<br/>
<img src="image 6.png" /><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However, this page still contains some decimal and \u00 encoded strings on it.<br/>

The decimal-encoded strings follow (Fig. 29)<br/>
