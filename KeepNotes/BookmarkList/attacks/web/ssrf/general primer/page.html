</head><body>SSRF exists when the server, as part of one of its features, fetches data or queries an internal or external resource. The key is that this request includes a value that the attacker can manipulate, potentially allowing the attacker to completely change the request being performed by the server.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, SSRF does not allow code execution, but it all depends on the particular implementation of the vulnerable code. It is common though, to leverage a SSRF vulnerability to attack internal applications.<br/>
