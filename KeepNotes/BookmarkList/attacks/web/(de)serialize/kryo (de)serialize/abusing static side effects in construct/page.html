<title>Abusing Static Side Effects in Constructors</title>
</head><body>Here’s a class in ColdFusion that clobbers a singleton that you can control:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; package coldfusion.syndication;<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; import com.sun.syndication.io.impl.CFDateParser;<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public class FeedDateParser implements CFDateParser {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; private FeedDateParser() {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DateParser.registerCFDateParser(this);<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;} &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>
<br/>
Clearly this method was only intended to be called once. What will happen if I send you a Kryo-serialized version of FeedDateParser that has null fields? Answer: a super efficient application DoS. I will override the singleton with my malicious version, filled with null field members. This will cause NullPointerExceptions to start getting thrown everywhere, as everyone uses it. A single HTTP request could take you down completely.<br/>
<br/>
Notice that the constructor is private. Kryo doesn’t care. This isn’t cool, to me. If I mark a constructor private, I intend for it to be created in only the ways I allow. There may be good reasons for that -- maybe even security reasons! However, Kryo users reported not supporting private constructors as a bug, and the library maintainers added support.<br/>
<br/>
There is lots of havoc you can cause with constructors. Although I’m sure one is out there, there’s no killer remote code execution using this strategy that I’ve been able to find.</body></html>
