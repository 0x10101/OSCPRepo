</head><body>The cool and scary part of Kryo is that you can use it to serialize or deserialize any Java types, not necessarily those that are marked with java.io.Serializable. This makes development a lot easier for many situations, like serializing already existing stuff, or serializing stuff you can’t control.<br/>
<br/>
When you use Kryo to deserialize an object, you must declare which type you're expecting. Here’s an example:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; // serializing<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kryo kryo = new Kryo();<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; AcmeMessage message = buildAcmeMessage(); // some domain object<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Output out = new Output(response.getOutputStream())<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; kryo.writeObject(out, myObject);<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; // deserializing<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Input in = new Input(request.getInputStream());<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; AcmeMessage message = kryo.readObject(in, AcmeMessage.class);<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bait and Switch</b><br/>
This one was actually easy to get around. In the real world, any domain object that folks send back and forth will have collections -- maps, lists, arrays, or something like that. Let's consider the following example object: &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/* AcmeMessage.java */<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; private List&lt;AcmeRecipient&gt; recipients;<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere that matters, that &lt;AcmeRecipient&gt; bit of code does not exist. The only place it does matter is compile time. I live in the runtime, where exploits occur. This means for our purposes, that code should be understood as this instead:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; /* AcmeMessage.java */ <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; private List&lt;Object&gt; recipients; &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
So, if our target app is deserializing an AcmeMessage type, we can stuff some unexpected, arbitrary types into the recipients field, because all types extend Object. Now, much like with the seriapalooza attacks, the types the attacker uses must still be on the classpath of the victim application, libraries, or server.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if the app ever tries to use one of those objects as an AcmeMessage, it will blow up -- but our attack should be reaching fruition before that time.<br/>
<br/>
After looking at the code, we appear to only have one rule: the class must have a no-arg constructor. Senses tingling now.<br/>
<br/>
At a high level, Kryo deserializes with this pattern:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Get the zero-arg constructor for the given type<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If it’s private, mark it as accessible<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Call the constructor<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For every field in the type:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deserialize the field passed in the message (recurse)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assign the field to the new type created in #3<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to override this existing behavior with even more abusable behavior, but let’s focus on the default settings.<br/>
<br/>
<b>If you let developers specify arbitrary behaviors in their types’ Serializable#readObject() methods, you’ll be able to chain their side effects together so that they eventually add up to disaster</b>. And that’s what happened.<br/>
<br/>
And this isn’t very different.<br/>
<br/>
I can submit an arbitrary class that’s on your classpath, and you (the victim app) will call its constructor. Developers can put whatever they want in their constructors. They’re not guaranteed to avoid having side effects.</body></html>
