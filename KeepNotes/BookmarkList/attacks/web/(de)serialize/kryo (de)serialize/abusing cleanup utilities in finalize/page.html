<title>Abusing Cleanup Utilities in Finalize</title>
</head><body>Abusing Cleanup Utilities in finalize() <br/>
Constructors aren’t the only source of side effects we can use to affect change.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
If a class has implemented an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#finalize()">Object#finalize()</a>&nbsp;method, Java will invoke it before the object gets garbage collected. Developers use this method to clean up any non-JVM resources that may not have been cleaned up correctly. Because it’s called automatically, it’s possible to abuse any side effects that may occur in this method, without the app acting on your malicious object at all! In fact, their throwing it away is a necessary step in the exploitation process.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Here are a few types you can use to do some funny stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Attack #1: Delete Arbitrary Files (org.jpedal.io.ObjectStore)</b><br/>
<br/>
By far, the most commonly abusable tactic in finalize() is messing with files. It makes sense; a type is somehow “backed” by a temp file, and the finalize() is a clear message that the file can be cleaned up.<br/>
<br/>
The first type I found with this capability also happened to be in ColdFusion 10: org.jpedal.io.ObjectStore. When analyzing classes to determine potential Kryo finalize() exploit gadgets, you only need to look at two things: the zero-argument constructor and the finalize() method. Those are the only things that will happen. You can control the fields, as long as they are also objects that can be created with zero-argument constructors. Here’s the constructor:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public ObjectStore() {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; init();<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>
<br/>
Doesn’t do much. Anything it does is undone anyway, because Kryo copies our state over the top of their state, once the constructor is finished executing. And next, the finalize():<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; protected void finalize() {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;flush();<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; protected void flush() {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; /**<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* flush any image data serialized as bytes<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*/ Iterator filesTodelete = imagesOnDiskAsBytes.keySet().iterator(); <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while(filesTodelete.hasNext()) { <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;final Object file = filesTodelete.next(); &nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(file! = null){ &nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; final File delete_file = new File((String)imagesOnDiskAsBytes.get(file));<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if(delete_file.exists()) {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;delete_file.delete();<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;...<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; } &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
This means all you do is provide a java.util.Map that contains String file paths as values in the imagesonDiskAsBytes field, and the JVM will delete them for you! Cheers!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Attack #2: Memory Corruption (multiple types)</b><br/>
<br/>
I’m definitely not the best person to chase this lead down, but we can use the following gadgets to create memory corruption bug primitives. They all call free() on a user-controlled memory address:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; com.sun.jna.Memory, packaged with Vert.x<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; com.sun.medialib.codec.jpeg.Encoder (no source available), part of ColdFusion 10<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; com.sun.medialib.codec.png.Decoder (no source available), part of ColdFusion 10<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; com.xuggle.ferry.AtomicInteger, part of Liferay (also the xuggle library)<br/>
<br/>
I’m sure there are more out there, but these few are already available on a lot of popular platforms. Let’s take a look at the com.sun.jna.Memory#finalize() call:<br/>
<br/>
That free() is indeed delegated to the stdlib.h::free() function. For the uninitiated, this is incredibly dangerous. The test case that proves memory corruption <a href="https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/serialbox/blob/master/src/test/java/com/contrastsecurity/serialbox/KryoTest.java#L191">is here</a>. The test is disabled, but you can enable it by changing it to public from private. When enabled, the test case crashes the JVM.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Attack #3: Close Any File Descriptors (java.net.DatagramSocket)</b><br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of these, and much like the other attack types, I haven’t fully explored them all. However, the most obvious one is in java.net.PlainDatagramSocketImpl, packaged with the JRE.<br/>
<br/>
There is no explicit constructor in the type, nor any superclass up until java.lang.Object. There is, however, a java.io.FileDescriptor field called fd in its grandparent, java.net.DatagramSocketImpl.<br/>
<br/>
The FileDescriptor type has a zero-argument constructor, and contains nothing but a simple integer to represent the file descriptor at the OS level. The finalize() kicks off the fun:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; protected void finalize() {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;close();<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; /**<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* Close the socket.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; */<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; protected void close() { <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (fd != null) {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;datagramSocketClose();<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;…<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>
<br/>
This method is native, and as shown in this code from the HotSpot native layer, is just a plain old kill-this-file-descriptor-I-don’t-care-what-it-is close() from unistd.h.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; int os::close(int fd) {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return ::close(fd);<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; int os::socket_close(int fd) {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return ::close(fd);<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>
<br/>
See the testDatagramSocket() test case to verify this gadget. An attacker could submit many gadget instances and close every possible file descriptor. This would prevent socket communications with users, file reading or writing, or any IPC.<br/>
