<title>Mitigation</title>
</head><body>Remove vulnerable classes from libraries:<br/>
IE: remove the InvokerTransformer from Common Collections.<br/>
<br/>
Solution?<br/>
• Stop using Java serialization<br/>
• Use a secure JSON/XML serializer instead<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Prevent Data Leakage and Trusted Field Clobbering</b><br/>
If there are data members of an object that should never be controlled by end users during deserialization or exposed to users during serialization, they should be declared as<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/platform/serialization/spec/serial-arch.html#7231">&nbsp;the transient keyword</a>&nbsp;(section Protecting Sensitive Information).<br/>
<br/>
For a class that defined as Serializable, the sensitive information variable should be declared as private transient.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the class myAccount, the variable 'profit' and 'margin' were declared as transient to avoid to be serialized:<br/>
<br/>
public class myAccount implements Serializable<br/>
{<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; private transient double profit; // declared transient<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; private transient double margin; // declared transient<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ....<br/>
<br/>
<b>Prevent Deserialization of Domain Objects</b><br/>
Some of your application objects may be forced to implement Serializable due to their hierarchy. To guarantee that your application objects can't be deserialized, a readObject() method should be declared (with a final modifier) which always throws an exception:<br/>
<br/>
private final void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws java.io.IOException {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; throw new java.io.IOException("Cannot be deserialized");<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
<b>Harden Your Own java.io.ObjectInputStream</b><br/>
The java.io.ObjectInputStream class is used to deserialize objects. It's possible to harden its behavior by subclassing it. This is the best solution if:<br/>
<br/>
You can change the code that does the deserialization<br/>
You know what classes you expect to deserialize<br/>
<br/>
The general idea is to override <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#resolveClass(java.io.ObjectStreamClass)">ObjectInputStream.html#resolveClass()</a>&nbsp;in order to restrict which classes are allowed to be deserialized.<br/>
<br/>
Because this call happens before a readObject() is called, you can be sure that no deserialization activity will occur unless the type is one that you wish to allow.<br/>
<br/>
A simple example of this shown here, where the the LookAheadObjectInputStream class is guaranteed not to deserialize any other type besides the Bicycle class:<br/>
<br/>
public class LookAheadObjectInputStream extends ObjectInputStream {<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; public LookAheadObjectInputStream(InputStream inputStream) throws IOException {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; super(inputStream);<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; /**<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; * Only deserialize instances of our expected Bicycle class<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; */<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; @Override<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; protected Class&lt;?&gt; resolveClass(ObjectStreamClass desc) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (!desc.getName().equals(Bicycle.class.getName())) {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw new InvalidClassException("Unauthorized deserialization attempt", desc.getName());<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return super.resolveClass(desc);<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
More complete implementations of this approach have been proposed by various community members:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ikkisoft/SerialKiller">NibbleSec</a>&nbsp;- a library that allows whitelisting and blacklisting of classes that are allowed to be deserialized<br/>
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-lookahead/">IBM</a>&nbsp;- the seminal protection, written years before the most devastating exploitation scenarios were envisioned.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Harden All java.io.ObjectInputStream Usage with an Agent</b><br/>
As mentioned above, the java.io.ObjectInputStream class is used to deserialize objects. It's possible to harden its behavior by subclassing it. However, if you don't own the code or can't wait for a patch, using an agent to weave in hardening to java.io.ObjectInputStream is the best solution.<br/>
<br/>
Globally changing ObjectInputStream is only safe for blacklisting known malicious types, because it's not possible to know for all applications what the expected classes to be deserialized are. Fortunately, there are very few classes needed in the blacklist to be safe from all the known attack vectors, today.<br/>
<br/>
It's inevitable that more "gadget" classes will be discovered that can be abused. However, there is an incredible amount of vulnerable software exposed today, in need of a fix. In some cases, "fixing" the vulnerability may involve re-architecting messaging systems and breaking backwards compatibility as developers move towards not accepting serialized objects.<br/>
<br/>
To enable these agents, simply add a new JVM parameter:<br/>
<br/>
-javaagent:name-of-agent.jar<br/>
Agents taking this approach have been released by various community members:<br/>

<br/>
A similar, but less scalable approach would be to manually patch and bootstrap your JVM's ObjectInputStream. Guidance on this approach is available <a href="https://github.com/wsargent/paranoid-java-serialization">here</a>.</body></html>
