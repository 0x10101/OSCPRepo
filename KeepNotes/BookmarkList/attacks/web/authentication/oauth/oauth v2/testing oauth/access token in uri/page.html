<title>Access Token In URI</title>
</head><body>Access token part of the URI<br/>
<br/>
Because of the security weaknesses associated with the URI method, including the high likelihood that the URL containing the access token will be logged, it SHOULD NOT be used unless it is impossible to transport the access token in the "Authorization" request header field or the HTTP request entity-body. Resource servers MAY support this method.</body></html>
