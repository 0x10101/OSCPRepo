<title>Credential Stuffing</title>
</head><body><b>Description</b><br/>
Credential stuffing is the automated injection of breached username/password pairs in order to fraudulently gain access to user accounts. This is a subset of the brute force attack category: large numbers of spilled credentials are automatically entered into websites until they are potentially matched to an existing account, which the attacker can then hijack for their own purposes.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Uniqueness</b><br/>
Credential stuffing is a new form of attack to accomplish account takeover through automated web injection. Credential stuffing is related to the breaching of databases; both accomplish account takeover. Credential stuffing is an emerging threat.<br/>
<br/>
Credential stuffing is dangerous to both consumers and enterprises because of the ripple effects of these breaches. For more information on this please reference the Examples section showing the connected chain of events from one breach to another through credential stuffing.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Severity</b><br/>
Credential stuffing is one of the most common techniques used to take-over user accounts.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Anatomy of Attack</b><br/>
The attacker acquires spilled usernames and passwords from a website breach or password dump site.<br/>
The attacker uses an account checker to test the stolen credentials against many websites (for instance, social media sites or online marketplaces).<br/>
Successful logins (usually 0.1-0.2% of the total login attempts) allow the attacker to take over the account matching the stolen credentials.<br/>
The attacker drains stolen accounts of stored value, credit card numbers, and other personally identifiable information<br/>
The attacker may also use account information going forward for other nefarious purposes (for example, to send spam or create further transactions)</body></html>
