</head><body><br/>
Wednesdayâ€™s report is the latest reminder of the importance of locking down DNS networks. Measures include:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Using DNSSEC for both signing zones and validating responses</li>
<li>Using Registry Lock or similar services to help protect domain name records from being changed</li>
<li>Using access control lists for applications, Internet traffic, and monitoring</li>
<li>Mandating multi-factor authentication for all users, including subcontractors</li>
<li>Using strong passwords, with the help of password managers if necessary</li>
<li>Regularly reviewing accounts with registrars and other providers to check for signs of compromise</li>
<li>Monitoring for the issuance of unauthorized TLS certificates for domains</li>
</ul>
