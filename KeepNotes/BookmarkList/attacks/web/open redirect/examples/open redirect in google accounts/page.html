<title>Open Redirect In Google Accounts</title>
</head><body>The search for open redirect in https://chat.google.com turned out to be much easier than I had initially thought. Any URL under https://chat.google.com/accounts is redirected to https://accounts.google.com. For example, check this out: https://chat.google.com/accounts/random-url. You should end up on https://accounts.google.com/random-url after clicking.<br/>
<br/>
The redirect to accounts.google.com is just a first step in the riddle. But in fact the most important one as there exists a well-known, publicly disclosed open redirect on accounts.google.com (credit: @teh_h3ck). Please refer to the original blog post to find out details but the idea is that basically I can redirect to my own domain, I just need to host stuff on /_ah/conflogin URL.<br/>
<br/>
So the final open redirect from chat.google.com is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
https://chat.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?continue=https://appengine.google.com/_ah/conflogin?continue=http://bentkowski.info/&amp;service=ah</body></html>
