</head><body>CSP Bypass, "bad chars" to attempt to bypass:<br/>
https://apapedulimu.click/clickjacking-on-google-myaccount-worth-7500/<br/>
I just adding illegal character on the origin parameter. I try to put URL Encode before the business.google.com. Become like this:<br/>
https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/brandaccounts/group/101656179839819660704/managers?originProduct=AC&amp;origin=https://%0d.business.google.com <br/>
And csp is bypassed! <br/>
<br/>
Likely, %0d (carriage return) broke the parser or some such and allowed it to pass. </body></html>
