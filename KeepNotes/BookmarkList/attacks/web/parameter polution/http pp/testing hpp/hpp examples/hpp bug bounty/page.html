<br/>
and I went to check whether supplying multiple “email” parameters causes the backend application framework to work differently. I added attacker’s email id and the tampered request looks like-<br/>
<img src="image 2.png" /><br/>
<br/>
and as I was expecting , the backend application (JSP in this case)took the value of first “email” parameter to generate the password reset link and used the value supplied in the second “email” value to trigger the send mail to “petercheckk852234@gmail.com . Because of which “attacker” receive the link to reset password of “victims” account.<br/>
