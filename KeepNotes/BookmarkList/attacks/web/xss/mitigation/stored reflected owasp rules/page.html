<title>Stored Reflected OWASP Rules</title>
</head><body><b>RULE #0 </b>- Never Insert Untrusted Data Except in Allowed Locations<br/>
The first rule is to deny all - don't put untrusted data into your HTML document unless it is within one of the slots defined in Rule #1 through Rule #5. The reason for Rule #0 is that there are so many strange contexts within HTML that the list of escaping rules gets very complicated. We can't think of any good reason to put untrusted data in these contexts. This includes "nested contexts" like a URL inside a javascript -- the encoding rules for those locations are tricky and dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
If you insist on putting untrusted data into nested contexts, please do a lot of cross-browser testing and let us know what you find out.<br/>
<br/>
Directly in a script:<br/>
&lt;script&gt;...NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE...&lt;/script&gt; &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Inside an HTML comment:<br/>
&lt;!--...NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE...--&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
In an attribute name:<br/>
&lt;div ...NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE...=test /&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
In a tag name:<br/>
&lt;NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE... href="/test" /&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Directly in CSS:<br/>
&lt;style&gt;<br/>
...NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE...<br/>
&lt;/style&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, never accept actual JavaScript code from an untrusted source and then run it. For example, a parameter named "callback" that contains a JavaScript code snippet. No amount of escaping can fix that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>RULE #1</b>&nbsp;- HTML Escape Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML Element Content<br/>
Rule #1 is for when you want to put untrusted data directly into the HTML body somewhere. This includes inside normal tags like div, p, b, td, etc. Most web frameworks have a method for HTML escaping for the characters detailed below. However, this is absolutely not sufficient for other HTML contexts. You need to implement the other rules detailed here as well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;body&gt;<br/>
...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...<br/>
&lt;/body&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;div&gt;<br/>
...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...<br/>
&lt;/div&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Escape the following characters with HTML entity encoding to prevent switching into any execution context, such as script, style, or event handlers. Using hex entities is recommended in the spec. In addition to the 5 characters significant in XML (&amp;, &lt;, &gt;, ", '), the forward slash is included as it helps to end an HTML entity.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&amp; --&gt; &amp;amp;<br/>
&nbsp;&lt; --&gt; &amp;lt;<br/>
&nbsp;&gt; --&gt; &amp;gt;<br/>
&nbsp;" --&gt; &amp;quot;<br/>
&nbsp;' --&gt; &amp;#x27; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp;/ --&gt; &amp;#x2F; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&amp;apos; not recommended because its not in the HTML spec (See: section 24.4.1) &amp;apos; is in the XML and XHTML specs.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Forward slash is included as it helps end an HTML entity<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>RULE #2</b>&nbsp;- Attribute Escape Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML Common Attributes<br/>
Rule #2 is for putting untrusted data into typical attribute values like width, name, value, etc. This should not be used for complex attributes like href, src, style, or any of the event handlers like onmouseover. It is extremely important that event handler attributes should follow Rule #3 for HTML JavaScript Data Values.<br/>
<br/>
Inside UNquoted attribute:<br/>
&lt;div attr=...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...&gt;content<br/>
<br/>
Inside single quoted attribute:<br/>
&lt;div attr='...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...'&gt;content<br/>
<br/>
Inside double quoted attribute :<br/>
&lt;div attr="...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE..."&gt;content<br/>
<br/>
Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with the &amp;#xHH; format (or a named entity if available) to prevent switching out of the attribute.<br/>
<br/>
The reason this rule is so broad is that developers frequently leave attributes unquoted. Properly quoted attributes can only be escaped with the corresponding quote.<br/>
<br/>
Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters, including [space] % * + , - / ; &lt; = &gt; ^ and |.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>RULE #3</b>&nbsp;- JavaScript Escape Before Inserting Untrusted Data into JavaScript Data Values<br/>
Rule #3 concerns dynamically generated JavaScript code - both script blocks and event-handler attributes. The only safe place to put untrusted data into this code is inside a quoted "data value." Including untrusted data inside any other JavaScript context is quite dangerous, as it is extremely easy to switch into an execution context with characters including (but not limited to) semi-colon, equals, space, plus, and many more, so use with caution.<br/>
<br/>
Inside a quoted string:<br/>
&lt;script&gt;alert('...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...')&lt;/script&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
One side of a quoted expression:<br/>
&lt;script&gt;x='...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...'&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Inside quoted event handler:<br/>
&lt;div onmouseover="x='...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...'"&lt;/div&gt; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Please note there are some JavaScript functions that can never safely use untrusted data as input - EVEN IF JAVASCRIPT ESCAPED!<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
&lt;script&gt;<br/>
window.setInterval('...EVEN IF YOU ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA YOU ARE XSSED HERE...');<br/>
&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters less than 256 with the \xHH format to prevent switching out of the data value into the script context or into another attribute. DO NOT use any escaping shortcuts like \" because the quote character may be matched by the HTML attribute parser which runs first. These escaping shortcuts are also susceptible to escape-the-escape attacks where the attacker sends \" and the vulnerable code turns that into \\" which enables the quote.<br/>
<br/>
If an event handler is properly quoted, breaking out requires the corresponding quote. However, we have intentionally made this rule quite broad because event handler attributes are often left unquoted. Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters including [space] % * + , - / ; &lt; = &gt; ^ and |.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a &lt;/script&gt; closing tag will close a script block even though it is inside a quoted string because the HTML parser runs before the JavaScript parser. Please note this is an aggressive escaping policy that over-encodes. If there is a guarantee that proper quoting is accomplished then a much smaller character set is needed. Please look at the OWASP Java Encoder JavaScript escaping examples for examples of proper JavaScript use that requires minimal escaping.<br/>
<br/>
<b>RULE #3.1</b>&nbsp;- HTML escape JSON values in an HTML context and read the data with JSON.parse<br/>
In a Web 2.0 world, the need for having data dynamically generated by an application in a javascript context is common. One strategy is to make an AJAX call to get the values, but this isn't always performant. Often, an initial block of JSON is loaded into the page to act as a single place to store multiple values. This data is tricky, though not impossible, to escape correctly without breaking the format and content of the values.<br/>
<br/>
Ensure returned Content-Type header is application/json and not text/html. This shall instruct the browser not misunderstand the context and execute injected script<br/>
<br/>

.....<br/>
A common anti-pattern one would see:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;script&gt;<br/>
// Do NOT do this without encoding the data with one of the techniques listed below.<br/>
var initData = &lt;%= data.to_json %&gt;; <br/>
&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<b>JSON serialization</b><br/>
A safe JSON serializer will allow developers to serialize JSON as string of literal JavaScript which can be embedded in an HTML in the contents of the &lt;script&gt; tag. HTML characters and JavaScript line terminators need be escaped. Consider the Yahoo JavaScript Serializer for this task.<br/>
<br/>
<b>HTML entity encoding</b><br/>
This technique has the advantage that html entity escaping is widely supported and helps separate data from server side code without crossing any context boundaries. Consider placing the JSON block on the page as a normal element and then parsing the innerHTML to get the contents. The javascript that reads the span can live in an external file, thus making the implementation of CSP enforcement easier.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;div id="init_data" style="display: none"&gt;<br/>
&nbsp;&lt;%= html_escape(data.to_json) %&gt;<br/>
&lt;/div&gt;<br/>
<br/>
// external js file<br/>
var dataElement = document.getElementById('init_data');<br/>
// decode and parse the content of the div<br/>
var initData = JSON.parse(dataElement.textContent);<br/>
<br/>
An alternative to escaping and unescaping JSON directly in JavaScript, is to normalize JSON server-side by converting &lt; to \u003c before delivering it to the browser.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>RULE #4 </b>- CSS Escape And Strictly Validate Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML Style Property Values<br/>
Rule #4 is for when you want to put untrusted data into a stylesheet or a style tag. CSS is surprisingly powerful, and can be used for numerous attacks. Therefore, it's important that you only use untrusted data in a property value and not into other places in style data. You should stay away from putting untrusted data into complex properties like url, behavior, and custom (-moz-binding).<br/>
<br/>
You should also not put untrusted data into IE’s expression property value which allows JavaScript.<br/>
<br/>
Property value:<br/>
&lt;style&gt;<br/>
selector { property : ...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE...; }<br/>
&lt;/style&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;style&gt;<br/>
selector { property : "...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE..."; }<br/>
&lt;/style&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;span style="property : ...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE..."&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;<br/>
Please note there are some CSS contexts that can never safely use untrusted data as input - EVEN IF PROPERLY CSS ESCAPED! You will have to ensure that URLs only start with http not javascript and that properties never start with "expression".<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
{ background-url : "javascript:alert(1)"; } &nbsp;// and all other URLs<br/>
{ text-size: "expression(alert('XSS'))"; } &nbsp; // only in IE<br/>
Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with the \HH escaping format. DO NOT use any escaping shortcuts like \" because the quote character may be matched by the HTML attribute parser which runs first. These escaping shortcuts are also susceptible to escape-the-escape attacks where the attacker sends \" and the vulnerable code turns that into \\" which enables the quote.<br/>
<br/>
If attribute is quoted, breaking out requires the corresponding quote. All attributes should be quoted but your encoding should be strong enough to prevent XSS when untrusted data is placed in unquoted contexts.<br/>
<br/>
Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters including [space] % * + , - / ; &lt; = &gt; ^ and |.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the &lt;/style&gt; tag will close the style block even though it is inside a quoted string because the HTML parser runs before the JavaScript parser. Please note that we recommend aggressive CSS encoding and validation to prevent XSS attacks for both quoted and unquoted attributes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>RULE #5</b>&nbsp;- URL Escape Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML URL Parameter Values<br/>
Rule #5 is for when you want to put untrusted data into HTTP GET parameter value.<br/>
&lt;a href="http://www.somesite.com?test=...ESCAPE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE..."&gt;link&lt;/a &gt; &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Except for alphanumeric characters, escape all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with the %HH escaping format. Including untrusted data in data: URLs should not be allowed as there is no good way to disable attacks with escaping to prevent switching out of the URL.<br/>
<br/>
All attributes should be quoted. Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters including [space] % * + , - / ; &lt; = &gt; ^ and |. Note that entity encoding is useless in this context.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING: Do not encode complete or relative URL's with URL encoding! If untrusted input is meant to be placed into href, src or other URL-based attributes, it should be validated to make sure it does not point to an unexpected protocol, especially javascript links. URL's should then be encoded based on the context of display like any other piece of data. For example, user driven URL's in HREF links should be attribute encoded.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
String userURL = request.getParameter( "userURL" )<br/>
boolean isValidURL = Validator.IsValidURL(userURL, 255); <br/>
if (isValidURL) { &nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;a href="&lt;%=encoder.encodeForHTMLAttribute(userURL)%&gt;"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>RULE #6</b>&nbsp;- Sanitize HTML Markup with a Library Designed for the Job<br/>
If your application handles markup -- untrusted input that is supposed to contain HTML -- it can be very difficult to validate. Encoding is also difficult, since it would break all the tags that are supposed to be in the input. Therefore, you need a library that can parse and clean HTML formatted text. There are several available at OWASP that are simple to use:<br/>
<br/>
HtmlSanitizer<br/>
An open-source .Net library. The HTML is cleaned with a white list approach. All allowed tags and attributes can be configured. The library is unit tested with the OWASP XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet<br/>
<br/>
var sanitizer = new HtmlSanitizer();<br/>
sanitizer.AllowedAttributes.Add("class");<br/>
var sanitized = sanitizer.Sanitize(html);<br/>
<br/>
OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer<br/>
import org.owasp.html.Sanitizers;<br/>
import org.owasp.html.PolicyFactory;<br/>
PolicyFactory sanitizer = Sanitizers.FORMATTING.and(Sanitizers.BLOCKS);<br/>
String cleanResults = sanitizer.sanitize("&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;b&gt;World!&lt;/b&gt;");<br/>
<br/>
For more information on OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer policy construction, see here.<br/>
<br/>
Ruby on Rails SanitizeHelper<br/>
The SanitizeHelper module provides a set of methods for scrubbing text of undesired HTML elements.<br/>
&lt;%= sanitize @comment.body, tags: %w(strong em a), attributes: %w(href) %&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Other libraries that provide HTML Sanitization include:<br/>
HTML sanitizer from Google Closure Library<br/>
PHP HTML Purifier.<br/>
JavaScript/Node.js Bleach.<br/>
Python Bleach.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>RULE #7</b>&nbsp;- Prevent DOM-based XSS<br/>
For details on what DOM-based XSS is, and defenses against this type of XSS flaw, please see the OWASP article on DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bonus Rule #1</b>: Use HTTPOnly cookie flag<br/>
Preventing all XSS flaws in an application is hard, as you can see. To help mitigate the impact of an XSS flaw on your site, OWASP also recommends you set the HTTPOnly flag on your session cookie and any custom cookies you have that are not accessed by any Javascript you wrote. This cookie flag is typically on by default in .NET apps, but in other languages you have to set it manually. For more details on the HTTPOnly cookie flag, including what it does, and how to use it, see the OWASP article on HTTPOnly.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bonus Rule #2</b>: Implement Content Security Policy<br/>
There is another good complex solution to mitigate the impact of an XSS flaw called Content Security Policy. It's a browser side mechanism which allows you to create source whitelists for client side resources of your web application, e.g. JavaScript, CSS, images, etc. CSP via special HTTP header instructs the browser to only execute or render resources from those sources.<br/>
<br/>
For example this CSP:<br/>
<br/>
Content-Security-Policy: default-src: 'self'; script-src: 'self' static.domain.tld<br/>
Will instruct web browser to load all resources only from the page's origin and JavaScript source code files additionaly from static.domain.tld. For more details on Content Security Policy, including what it does, and how to use it, see this article on Content Security Policy.<br/>
<b><br/>
</b><b>Bonus Rule #3</b>: Use an Auto-Escaping Template System<br/>
Many web application frameworks provide automatic contextual escaping functionality such as AngularJS strict contextual escaping and Go Templates. Use these technologies when you can.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bonus Rule #4</b>: Use the X-XSS-Protection Response Header<br/>
This HTTP response header enables the Cross-site scripting (XSS) filter built into some modern web browsers. This header is usually enabled by default anyway, so the role of this header is to re-enable the filter for this particular website if it was disabled by the user.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bonus Rule #5</b>: Properly use modern JS frameworks like Angular (2+) or ReactJS<br/>
Modern javascript frameworks have pretty good XSS protection built in. It is important how to use them properly to benefit from it.<br/>
<br/>
When using ReactJS do not use dangerouslySetInnerHTML. If you really, really really have to use dangerouslySetInnerHTML remember that now all framework protections are turned off and you have to escape or sanitize all the data by yourself.<br/>
<br/>
For Angular (2+) remember to build Angular templates with -prod parameter (ng build --prod) in order to avoid template injection.<br/>
<br/>
And also remember to update your framework to the newest version, with all possible bug fixes, as soon as possible.</body></html>
