<title>Verify Origin</title>
</head><body><b>Verifying origin with standard headers</b><br/>
This defense technique is specifically proposed in section 5.0 of <a href="https://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/csrf/csrf.pdf">Robust Defenses for Cross-Site Request</a>&nbsp;Forgery. This paper proposes the first creation of the Origin header and its use as a CSRF defense mechanism.<br/>
<br/>
There are two steps to this mitigation, both of which rely on examining an HTTP request header value.<br/>
<br/>
Determining the origin the request is coming from (source origin). Can be done via Origin and/or referer header.<br/>
Determining the origin the request is going to (target origin).<br/>
<br/>
At server side we verify if both of them match. If they do, we accept the request as legitimate (meaning it’s the same origin request) and if they don’t, we discard the request (meaning that the request originated from cross-domain). Reliability on these headers comes from the fact that they cannot be altered programmatically (using JavaScript in an XSS) as they fall under <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_header_name">forbidden headers</a>&nbsp;list (i.e., only browsers can set them).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Identifying Source Origin (via Origin/Referer header)</b><br/>
<b>Checking the Origin Header</b><br/>
<br/>
If the Origin header is present, verify that its value matches the target origin. Unlike the Referer, the Origin header will be present in HTTP requests that originate from an HTTPS URL.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Checking the Referer Header</b><br/>
<br/>
If the Origin header is not present, verify the hostname in the Referer header matches the target origin. This method of CSRF mitigation is also commonly used with unauthenticated requests, such as requests made prior to establishing a session state, which is required to keep track of a synchronization token.<br/>
<br/>
In both cases, make sure the target origin check is strong. For example, if your site is site.com make sure site.com.attacker.com does not pass your origin check (i.e., match through the trailing / after the origin to make sure you are matching against the entire origin).<br/>
<br/>
If neither of these headers are present, you can either accept or block the request. We recommend blocking. Alternatively, you might want to log all such instances, monitor their use cases/behavior, and then start blocking requests only after you get enough confidence.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Identifying the Target Origin</b><br/>
You might think it’s easy to determine the target origin, but it’s frequently not. The first thought is to simply grab the target origin (i.e., its hostname and port #) from the URL in the request. However, the application server is frequently sitting behind one or more proxies and the original URL is different from the URL the app server actually receives. If your application server is directly accessed by its users, then using the origin in the URL is fine and you're all set.<br/>
<br/>
If you are behind a proxy, there are a number of options to consider.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Configure your application to simply know its target origin</b>: It’s your application, so you can find its target origin and set that value in some server configuration entry. This would be the most secure approach as its defined server side, so it is a trusted value. However, this might be problematic to maintain if your application is deployed in many places, e.g., dev, test, QA, production, and possibly multiple production instances. Setting the correct value for each of these situations might be difficult, but if you can do it via some central configuration and providing your instances to grab value from it, that's great! (Note: Make sure the centralized configuration store is maintained securely because major part of your CSRF defense depends on it.)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Use the Host header value</b>: If you prefer that the application find its own target so it doesn't have to be configured for each deployed instance, we recommend using the Host family of headers. The Host header's purpose is to contain the target origin of the request. But, if your app server is sitting behind a proxy, the Host header value is most likely changed by the proxy to the target origin of the URL behind the proxy, which is different than the original URL. This modified Host header origin won't match the source origin in the original Origin or Referer headers.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Use the X-Forwarded-Host header value</b>: To avoid the issue of proxy altering the host header, there is another header called X-Forwarded-Host, whose purpose is to contain the original Host header value the proxy received. Most proxies will pass along the original Host header value in the X-Forwarded-Host header. So that header value is likely to be the target origin value you need to compare to the source origin in the Origin or Referer header.<br/>
<br/>
This mitigation in earlier versions of the CSRF Cheat Sheet is treated as a primary defense. For reasons mentioned below, it is now moved to the Defense in Depth section.<br/>
<br/>
As it’s implicit, this mitigation would work properly when origin or referrer headers are present in the requests. Though these headers are included majority of the time, there are few use cases where they are not included (most of them are for legitimate reasons to safeguard users privacy/to tune to browsers ecosystem). The following lists some use cases:<br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">Internet Explorer 11 does not add the Origin header on a CORS request across sites of a trusted zone. The Referer header will remain the only indication of the UI origin. See the following references in stackoverflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20784209/internet-explorer-11-does-not-add-the-origin-header-on-a-cors-request">here</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/issues/118">here</a>.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">In an instance following a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22397072/are-there-any-browsers-that-set-the-origin-header-to-null-for-privacy-sensitiv">302 redirect cross-origin</a>, Origin is not included in the redirected request because that may be considered sensitive information that should not be sent to the other origin.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">There are some <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Origin#Privacy-Sensitive_Contexts">privacy contexts</a>&nbsp;where Origin is set to “null” For example, see the following <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=origin+header+sent+null+value+site%3Astackoverflow.com&oq=origin+header+sent+null+value+site%3Astackoverflow.com">here</a>.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">Origin header is included for all cross origin requests but for same origin requests, in most browsers it is only included in POST/DELETE/PUT Note: Although it is not ideal, many developers use GET requests to do state changing operations.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">Referer header is no exception. There are multiple use cases where referrer header is omitted as well (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6880659/in-what-cases-will-http-referer-be-empty">1 </a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer">2 </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer#Referer_hiding">3 </a>, <a href="https://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/csrf/csrf.pdf">4 </a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=referrer+header+sent+null+value+site:stackoverflow.com">5 </a>). Load balancers, proxies and embedded network devices are also well known to strip the referrer header due to privacy reasons in logging them.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Though exceptions can be written for above cases in your source and target origin check logic, there is currently no central repository (even there is one, keeping it up-to-date is a problem) that references all such use cases. Each browser might also handle these use cases differently (browsers are known to handle things differently considering their ecosystem. IE example of not sending origin header within trusted zone is such example). Rejecting requests that do not contain origin and/or referrer headers might sound like a good idea but it can impact legitimate users. Keeping this system in monitoring mode and trying to investigate use cases such as stated above, then adding them into exception logic is a process that you may consider to make this defense more stable in your environment.<br/>
<br/>
This CSRF defense relies on browser behavior that can change at times. For example, when new privacy contexts are discovered, under which situations you have to keep your validation logic updated, where as in token based mitigation, you have full control on the CSRF mitigation. If browsers alter CSRF tokens, they are literally changing the HTML content on rendering pages (which no browser would ever want to do!).<br/>
<br/>
When there is an XSS vulnerability on a page of an application protected with Origin and/or Referrer header, the level of effort required to exploit state changing operations (that are typically vulnerable to CSRF) on other pages is very easy (grab the parameters and forge a request, as Origin and Referrer header is included by default by browsers) than compared to token based mitigation (where attacker needs to download the target page, parse the DOM for the token, construct a forge request, and send it to server).<br/>
<br/>
Note: Although the concept of origin header stemmed from <a href="https://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/csrf/csrf.pdf">this</a>&nbsp;paper that references robust CSRF defenses, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454">initial origin header RFC</a>&nbsp;does not reference to mitigate CSRF in any way (another <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-abarth-origin-03.html">draft version does</a>, however).</body></html>
