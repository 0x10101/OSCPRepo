<title>Mitigations For CSRF</title>
</head><body><b>Warning: No Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities</b><br/>
Cross-Site Scripting is not necessary for CSRF to work. However, any cross-site scripting vulnerability can be used to defeat all CSRF mitigation techniques available in the market today (except mitigation techniques that involve user interaction). This is because an XSS payload can simply read any page on the site using an XMLHttpRequest (direct DOM access can be done, if on same page) and obtain the generated token from the response, and include that token with a forged request.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few strategies to defend against the attack, generally with the goal of ensuring only the requests originating from the actual legitimate application are accepted.<br/>
<br/>
<b>CSRF tokens</b>&nbsp;are one of the most common strategies, often available at the web framework level. <br/>
These add a random value (often in a hidden form field) to the legitimate page in the application. One version of this implementation is to have the server cache this token. When the server receives a request, it will then check that the token is included and matches what the server has cached. It’s essential that the token is uniquely associated to a specific session, or else the attacker may be able to acquire a valid token to include. <br/>
<br/>
Another variant of this is to set the token in a cookie. Even though the CSRF request will include the cookie, this attack will not allow the attacker to read the cookie. As with the first example, the server will expect the body of the request to include the token, and then it will compare the token in the body against the token in the cookie. If they match, it’s treated as a valid request from the legitimate application. This approach alleviates the need to maintain CSRF token state on the server. <br/>
<br/>
One more approach, particularly for a web service API, is to have the legitimate application(s) supply the token via custom header. This means every JavaScript request from the client will need to add that header, however it also means that it cannot be supplied without triggering a CORS pre-flight.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Auto CSRF Mitigation Techniques</b><br/>
Though the technique of mitigating tokens is widely used (stateful with synchronizer token and stateless with encrypted/HMAC token), the major problem associated with these techniques is the human tendency to forget things at times. If a developer forgets to add the token to any state changing operation, they are making the application vulnerable to CSRF. To avoid this, you can try to automate the process of adding tokens to CSRF vulnerable resources (mentioned earlier in this document). You can achieve this by doing the following:<br/>
<br/>
Write wrappers (that would auto add tokens when used) around default form tags/ajax calls and educate your developers to use those wrappers instead of standard tags. Though this approach is better than depending purely on developers to add tokens, it still is vulnerable to the issue of human tendency to forget things. Spring Security uses this technique to add CSRF tokens by default when a custom &lt;form:form&gt; tag is used, you can opt to use after verifying that its enabled and properly configured in the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.0.CI-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/csrf.html">Spring Security</a>&nbsp;version you are using.<br/>
<br/>
Write a hook (that would capture the traffic and add tokens to CSRF vulnerable resources before rendering to customers) in your organizational web rendering frameworks. Because it is hard to analyze when a particular response is doing any state change (and thus needing a token), you might want to include tokens in all CSRF vulnerable resources (ex: include tokens in all POST responses). This is one recommended approach, but you need to consider the performance costs it might incur.<br/>
<br/>
Get the tokens automatically added on the client side when the page is being rendered in user’s browser, with help of a client side script (this approach is used by <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRF_Guard">CSRF Guard</a>). You need to consider any possible JavaScript hijacking attacks.<br/>
<br/>
We recommend researching if the framework you are using has an option to achieve CSRF protection by default before trying to build your custom auto tokening system. For example, .NET has an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery?view=aspnetcore-2.1">in-built protection</a>&nbsp;that adds token to CSRF vulnerable resources. You are responsible for proper configuration (such as key management and token management) before using these in-built CSRF protections that do auto tokening to CSRF vulnerable resources.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Credential re-prompts</b>&nbsp;effectively defeat the CSRF attack as well. Consider the common case of requiring the current password when assigning a new password. Because the attacker does not known the current password (if they did, they wouldn’t need the CSRF attack), they can’t supply that as part of the request.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Origin and Referrer checking</b>&nbsp;is yet another strategy. As I outlined in the CORS post, the browser will automatically include an Origin header (and usually referrer header, although there are some ways of manipulating it) &nbsp;on cross-site requests. While a custom script can easily spoof the Origin, validating these headers as matching the legitimate application is enough to solve the actual attack scenario since it required cookies/auth set in the victim’s browser. A bonus is that this strategy can often be built-into your CORS logic. If it’s a cross-origin request and the origin is not allowed (e.g. you would not reflect it in you access-control-allow-origin header), reject the request.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Out-of-Band required fields like a CAPTCHA</b>&nbsp;can effectively act like a CSRF token since they require input that is unknown to the attacker.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Multi-stage transactions</b>&nbsp;are more difficult to attack via CSRF. In particular, if there are multiple requests required and each one requires value(s) from the response to the previous request, the attacker has no means of obtaining those values. For example, if you fill out the create a user form, and you are directed to a confirmation page that prompts: are you sure you want to create this user? [y/n], and that confirmation form has an unpredictable transaction_id that the attacker wouldn’t know to be able to supply.<br/>
<br/>
Best practices mitigate some of the risk as well:<br/>
<ul><li>If you’re expecting a JSON payload, validate that the content-type is set to application/json. This immediately means that regular HTML forms can’t produce a well-formed JSON body, and JavaScript-based requests will be CORS pre-flighted.</li>
<li>HTTP Get requests often can’t practically have CSRF protection. If they follow the best practice of not mutating data or application state, they’re inherently not susceptible to CSRF.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>SameSite cookies work, but only when they are supported</b>. The reason I don’t like to recommend SameSite as an anti-CSRF measure is that unsupported browsers are still widely used, and will just ignore the flag.<br/>
https://caniuse.com/#search=samesite<br/>
I generally lean toward combining more than one solution, and certainly if you know you’re not expecting cross-site requests, using SameSite on your cookies could be one of the solutions. I just feel that in most cases it’s insufficient to trust on its own. Anyone using IE10, for example. would be completely unprotected against CSRF if the SameSite flag was the only defense.</body></html>
