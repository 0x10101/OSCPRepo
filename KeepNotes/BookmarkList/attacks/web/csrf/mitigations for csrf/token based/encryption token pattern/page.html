<title>Encryption Token Pattern</title>
</head><body><b>Encryption based Token Pattern</b><br/>
The Encrypted Token Pattern leverages an encryption, rather than comparison method of Token-validation. It is most suitable for applications that do not want to maintain any state at server side.<br/>
<br/>
After successful authentication, the server generates a unique token comprised of the user's ID, a timestamp value and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce">nonce</a>, using a unique key available only on the server. This token is returned to the client and embedded in a hidden field for forms, in the request-header/parameter for AJAX requests. On receipt of this request, the server reads and decrypts the token value with the same key used to create the token. Inability to correctly decrypt suggest an intrusion attempt. Once decrypted, the UserId and timestamp contained within the token are validated; the UserId is compared against the currently logged in user, and the timestamp is compared against the current time.<br/>
<br/>
On successful token-decryption, the server has access to parsed values, ideally in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity">claims</a>. These claims are processed by comparing the UserId claim to any potentially stored UserId (in a Cookie or Session variable, if the site already contains a means of authentication). The Timestamp is validated against the current time, preventing replay attacks. Alternatively, in the case of a CSRF attack, the server will be unable to decrypt the poisoned token, and can block and log the attack.<br/>
<br/>
This technique addresses some of the shortfalls in other stateless approaches, such as the need to store data in a Cookie, circumnavigating the Cookie-subdomain and HTTPONLY issues.</body></html>
