</head><body><b>Token Based Mitigation</b><br/>
This defense is one the most popular and recommended methods to mitigate CSRF. It can be achieved either with state (synchronizer token pattern) or stateless (encrypted/hash based token pattern). See section 4.3 on how to mitigate login CSRF in your applications. For all the mitigation's, it is implicit that general security principles should be adhered<br/>
<br/>
Strong encryption/HMAC functions should be adhered to.<br/>
<br/>
Note: You can select any algorithm per your organizational needs. We recommend AES256-GCM for encryption and SHA256/512 for HMAC.<br/>
<br/>
Strict key rotation and token lifetime policies should be maintained. Policies can be set according to your organizational needs. Generic key management guidance from OWASP can be found here.</body></html>
