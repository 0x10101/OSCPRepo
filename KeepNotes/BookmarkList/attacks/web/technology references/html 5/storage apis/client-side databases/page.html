<title>Client-side Databases</title>
</head><body><ul><li>On November 2010, the W3C announced Web SQL Database (relational SQL database) as a deprecated specification. A new standard Indexed Database API or IndexedDB (formerly WebSimpleDB) is actively developed, which provides key/value database storage and methods for performing advanced queries.</li>
<li>Underlying storage mechanisms may vary from one user agent to the next. In other words, any authentication your application requires can be bypassed by a user with local privileges to the machine on which the data is stored. Therefore, it's recommended not to store any sensitive information in local storage.</li>
<li>If utilized, WebDatabase content on the client side can be vulnerable to SQL injection and needs to have proper validation and parameterization.</li>
