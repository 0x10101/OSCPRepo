</head><body>Web Messaging<br/>
Web Messaging (also known as Cross Domain Messaging) provides a means of messaging between documents from different origins in a way that is generally safer than the multiple hacks used in the past to accomplish this task. However, there are still some recommendations to keep in mind:<br/>
<ul><li>When posting a message, explicitly state the expected origin as the second argument to postMessage rather than * in order to prevent sending the message to an unknown origin after a redirect or some other means of the target window's origin changing.</li>
<li>The receiving page should always:</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Check the origin attribute of the sender to verify the data is originating from the expected location.</li>
<li>Perform input validation on the data attribute of the event to ensure that it's in the desired format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't assume you have control over the data attribute. A single Cross Site Scripting flaw in the sending page allows an attacker to send messages of any given format.</li>
<li>Both pages should only interpret the exchanged messages as data. Never evaluate passed messages as code (e.g. via eval()) or insert it to a page DOM (e.g. via innerHTML), as that would create a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. For more information see DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet.</li>
<li>To assign the data value to an element, instead of using a insecure method like element.innerHTML=data;, use the safer option: element.textContent=data;</li>
<li>Check the origin properly exactly to match the FQDN(s) you expect. Note that the following code: if(message.orgin.indexOf(".owasp.org")!=-1) { /* ... */ } is very insecure and will not have the desired behavior as www.owasp.org.attacker.com will match.</li>
<li>If you need to embed external content/untrusted gadgets and allow user-controlled scripts (which is highly discouraged), consider using a JavaScript rewriting framework such as Google Caja or check the information on sandboxed frames.</li>
</ul>
