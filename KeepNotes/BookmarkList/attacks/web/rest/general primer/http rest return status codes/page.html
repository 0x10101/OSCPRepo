<title>HTTP REST Return Status Codes</title>
</head><body>HTTP Return Code<br/>
<br/>
HTTP defines status code. When designing REST API, don't just use 200 for success or 404 for error. Always use the semantically appropriate status code for the response.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a non-exhaustive selection of security related REST API status codes. Use it to ensure you return the correct code.<br/>
Code &#09;Message &#09;&#09;&#09;Decription<br/>
200 &#09;&#09;OK &#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;Response to a successful REST API action. The HTTP method can be GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE.<br/>
201 &#09;&#09;Created &#09;&#09;&#09;The request has been fulfilled and resource created. A URI for the created resource is returned in the Location header.<br/>
202 &#09;&#09;Accepted &#09;&#09;&#09;The request has been accepted for processing, but processing is not yet complete.<br/>
301 &#09;&#09;Moved Permanently &#09;Permanent redirection.<br/>
304 &#09;&#09;Not Modified &#09;&#09;Caching related response that returned when the client has the same copy of the resource as the server.<br/>
307 &#09;&#09;Temporary Redirect &#09;Temporary redirection of resource.<br/>
400 &#09;&#09;Bad Request &#09;&#09;The request is malformed, such as message body format error.<br/>
401 &#09;&#09;Unauthorized &#09;&#09;Wrong or no authentication ID/password provided.<br/>
403 &#09;&#09;Forbidden &#09;&#09;It's used when the authentication succeeded but authenticated user doesn't have permission to the request resource.<br/>
404 &#09;&#09;Not Found &#09;&#09;When a non-existent resource is requested.<br/>
405 &#09;&#09;Method Not Acceptable &#09;The error for an unexpected HTTP method. For example, the REST API is expecting HTTP GET, but HTTP PUT is used.<br/>
406 &#09;&#09;Unacceptable &#09;&#09;The client presented a content type in the Accept header which is not supported by the server API.<br/>
413 &#09;&#09;Payload too large &#09;Use it to signal that the request size exceeded the given limit e.g. regarding file uploads.<br/>
415 &#09;&#09;Unsupported Media Type &#09;The requested content type is not supported by the REST service.<br/>
429 &#09;&#09;Too Many Requests &#09;The error is used when there may be DOS attack detected or the request is rejected due to rate limiting.<br/>
500 &#09;&#09;Internal Server Error &#09;An unexpected condition prevented the server from fulfilling the request. Be aware that the response should not reveal internal information that helps an attacker, e.g. detailed error messages or stack traces.<br/>
501 &#09;&#09;Not Implemented &#09;The REST service does not implement the requested operation yet.<br/>
503 &#09;&#09;Service Unavailable &#09;The REST service is temporarily unable to process the request. Used to inform the client it should retry at a later time.<br/>
