<title>XML Serialization</title>
</head><body>Every REST API allows the raw input of XML to be converted to native objects. This deserialization process can be used to execute arbitrary code on the REST server.<br/>
<br/>
Mainly three mechanisms used by server logic:<ul><li>Server looks where to go before going</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Create an object based on the target type defined in the application then assign values from the xml to that instance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Server asks user where to go</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Create an object based on a user specified type in the provided XML then assign values (to public or private fields) from the XML to that instance, finally cast the created object to the target type defined in the application</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Server asks user where to go and what to do</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Create an object based on a user specified type in the provided XML then assign values from the XML to that instance, allow object sasignments, and invoke arbitrary methods on the newly created instance. Finally cast the created object to the target type defined in the application. </li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
