<title>CORS Bypass</title>
</head><body><b>Check for vulnerabilities in subdomains</b><br/>
Subdomains are not technically 'cross' origin (assuming origin is the entire domain), but allow an attacker to chain together vulnerabilities that may be present in a domain to a subdomain and then accross to another domain. <br/>
eg: <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/hacking-fortnite/">hacking fortnite</a>&nbsp;XSS in ut2004stats.epicgames.com can make requests to account.epicgames.com<br/>
<br/>
This could be considered a misconfiguration for 'overly permissive' CORS policy, eg: *.domain.com</body></html>
