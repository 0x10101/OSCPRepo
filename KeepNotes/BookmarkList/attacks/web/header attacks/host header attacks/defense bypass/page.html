<title>Defense Bypass</title>
</head><body>'Secured' configurations<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So far I've assumed that you can make a HTTP request with an arbitrary Host header arrive at any application. Given that the intended purpose of the Host header is to ensure that a request is passed to the correct application at a given IP address, it's not always that simple.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is trivial. If Apache receives an unrecognized Host header, it passes it to the first virtual host defined in httpd.conf. As such, it's possible to pass requests with arbitrary host headers directly to a sizable number of applications. <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>&nbsp;was aware of this default-vhost risk and responded by advising that users create a dummy default-vhost to act as a catchall for requests with unexpected Host headers, ensuring that Django applications never got passed requests with unexpected Host headers.<br/>
<br/>
The first bypass for this used X-Forwarded-For's friend, the <i>X-Forwarded-Host</i>&nbsp;header, which effectively overrode the Host header. Django was aware of the cache-poisoning risk and fixed this issue in <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2011/sep/09/security-releases-issued/">September 2011 </a>by disabling support for the X-Forwarded-Host header by default. Mozilla neglected to update addons.mozilla.org, which I discovered in April 2012 with the following request:<br/>
&gt; POST /en-US/firefox/user/pwreset HTTP/1.1&gt; Host: addons.mozilla.org<br/>
&gt; X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com<br/>
<br/>
Even patched Django installations were still vulnerable to attack. Webservers allow a port to be specified in the Host header, but ignore it for the purpose of deciding which virtual host to pass the request to. This is simple to exploit using the ever-useful http://username:password@domain.com syntax:<br/>
&gt; POST /en-US/firefox/user/pwreset HTTP/1.1&gt; Host: addons.mozilla.org:@passwordreset.net<br/>
<br/>
This resulted in the following (admittedly suspicious) password reset link:<br/>
https://addons.mozilla.org:@passwordreset.net/users/pwreset/3f6hp/3ab-9ae3db614fc0d0d036d4<br/>
<br/>
If you click it, you'll notice that your browser sends the key to passwordreset.net before creating the suspicious URL popup. Django released a patch for this issue shortly after I reported it: https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/oct/17/security/<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, Django's patch simply used a blacklist to filter @ and a few other characters. As the password reset email is sent in plaintext rather than HTML, a space breaks the URL into two separate links:<br/>
&gt; POST /en-US/firefox/users/pwreset HTTP/1.1<br/>
&gt; Host: addons.mozilla.org: www.securepasswordreset.com<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/dec/10/security/">Django's followup patch</a>&nbsp;ensured that the port specification in the Host header could only contain numbers, preventing the port-based attack entirely. &nbsp;However, the arguably ultimate authority on virtual hosting, <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">RFC2616</a>, has the following to say:<br/>
<br/>
5.2 The Resource Identified by a Request<br/>
[...]<br/>
If Request-URI is an absoluteURI, the host is part of the Request-URI. Any Host header field value in the request MUST be ignored.<br/>
<br/>
The result? On Apache and Nginx &nbsp;(and all compliant servers) it's possible to route requests with arbitrary host headers to any application present by using an absolute URI:<br/>
&gt; POST https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/users/pwreset HTTP/1.1<br/>
&gt; Host: evil.com<br/>
<br/>
This request results in a SERVER_NAME of addons.mozilla.org but a HTTP['HOST'] of evil.com. Applications that use SERVER_NAME rather than HTTP['HOST'] are unaffected by this particular trick, but can still be exploited on common server configurations. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2297421">HTTP_HOST vs. SERVER_NAME</a>&nbsp;for more information of the difference between these two variables. &nbsp;Django <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/feb/19/security/">fixed this in February 201</a>3 by enforcing a whitelist of allowed hosts. See the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/security/#host-header-validation">documentation</a>&nbsp;for more details. However, these attack techniques still work fine on many other web applications.<br/>
