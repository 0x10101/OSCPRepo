<b>@ symbol:</b><br/>
In actual fact, everything between "http://" and "@" is completely irrelevant! Just about anything can go in there and it makes no difference whatsoever to the final result.<br/>
This feature is actually used for authentication. If a login name and/or password is required to access a web page, it can be included here and login will be automatic.<br/>
<br/>
Example: http://username:password@www.whatever.com/secret/eyesonly.htm<br/>
<br/>
But if the page requires no authentication, the authentication text is in effect ignored by both browser and server.<br/>
the @ symbol can be represented by its hex code %40 to further confuse things; this works for the IE browser, but not for Netscape.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Number format equivalency</b><br/>
Merely using an IP address, in its usual dotted-decimal format, in place of the name is commonly done and can be quite effective at leaving the human reader in the dark about which website he's visiting.<br/>
<br/>
But there are other ways to express that same number. The alternate formats are:<br/>
<br/>
"dword" - meaning double word because it consists essentially of two binary "words" of 16 bits; but it is expressed in decimal (base 10);<br/>
"octal", meaning it's expressed in base 8; and<br/>
"hexadecimal" hexa=6 + deci=10 (base 16).<br/>
The dword equivalent of 206.191.158.55 is 3468664375.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Mix of all</b><br/>
Ah, you thought you had it all nailed down? Well, it's mix-and-match time!<br/>
Believe it or not, the following URL, which uses hex, decimal and octal numbers in the IP address, actually works: http://0xCE.191.0236.0x37/obscure.htm<br/>
This mixed-format address also works with bogus authentication text: http://spam-world.net@0xCE.191.0236.0x37/obscure.htm<br/>
For Netscape users, omitting the hex is necessary; but decimal and octal can be mixed: http://spam-world.net@0316.191.0236.067/obscure.htm<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Less Dots</b><br/>
A variation on the dword IP address is one where a portion of the IP address is similarly converted. This only works with the rightmost two or three numbers, not the leftmost.<br/>
<br/>
Let's start again with 206.191.158.55. Leaving the "206" as it is, we do the same calculation with the last three numbers:<br/>
<br/>
191 * 256 + 158 = * 256 + 55 = 12557879<br/>
Now we have: http://206.12557879/obscure.htm<br/>
<br/>
158 * 256 + 55 = 40503<br/>
Which results in: http://206.191.40503/obscure.htm<br/>
<br/>
Now extend this same concept to hex and octal numbers:<br/>
http://0xCE.0xBF9E37/obscure.htm <br/>
http://0xCE.0xBF.0x9E37/obscure.htm <br/>
http://0316.057717067/obscure.htm <br/>
http://0316.0277.0117067/obscure.htm<br/>
<br/>
Why not mix and match?<br/>
