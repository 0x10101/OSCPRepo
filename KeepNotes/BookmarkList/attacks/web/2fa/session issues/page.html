<title>Session Issues</title>
</head><body>Most of the time 2FA is implemented, it is on top of an existing authentication flow. This means that there is room for error when integrating a new step in the process. <br/>
<br/>
Assumptions: known user password AND code<br/>
In a certain <a href="https://medium.com/@lukeberner/how-i-abused-2fa-to-maintain-persistence-after-a-password-change-google-microsoft-instagram-7e3f455b71a1">case</a>: <br/>
Attempt to log in and wait at the 2FA prompt. <br/>
In an already authenticated session, change a security setting such as password or attempt to remove 2FA. <br/>
Now enter the current 2FA code in the first prompt (where you were waiting in step 1), and see if the application successfully authenticates.<br/>
<br/>
Issue:<br/>
ALL sessions are not being properly terminated. Typically, websites will attempt to invalidate old sessions after a 10-20 minute period or so. If the issue persists beyond this point, there could be a more serious issue. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Potential impacts include accound persistence:<br/>
This means that if an Attacker hijacks an account (leaks happen everyday), exploiting this vulnerability the new attack scenario would be:<br/>
<ul><li>An Attacker enables 2FA in Victimâ€™s account.</li>
<li>In another browser, Attacker waits indefinitely in the 2FA input page.</li>
<li>Attacker disables 2FA<b>.</b></li>
<li>The Victim regains access to the account (changing password &amp; resetting sessions)</li>
<li>Then the Attacker could input a valid 2FA code and have access again to the account, <b>without knowing the current password.</b></li>
</ul>
