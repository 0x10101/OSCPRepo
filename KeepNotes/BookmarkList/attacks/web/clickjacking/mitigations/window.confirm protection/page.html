<title>Window.Confirm Protection</title>
</head><body><b>window.confirm() Protection</b><br/>
The use of X-Frame-Options or a frame-breaking script is a more fail-safe method of clickjacking protection. However, in scenarios where content must be frameable, then a window.confirm() can be used to help mitigate Clickjacking by informing the user of the action they are about to perform.<br/>
<br/>
Invoking window.confirm() will display a popup that cannot be framed. If the window.confirm() originates from within an iframe with a different domain than the parent, then the dialog box will display what domain the window.confirm() originated from. In this scenario the browser is displaying the origin of the dialog box to help mitigate Clickjacking attacks. It should be noted that Internet Explorer is the only known browser that does not display the domain that the window.confirm() dialog box originated from, to address this issue with Internet Explorer insure that the message within the dialog box contains contextual information about the type of action being performed. For example:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;var action_confirm = window.confirm("Are you sure you want to delete your youtube account?")<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;if (action_confirm) {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;//... Perform action<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;} else {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;//... The user does not want to perform the requested action.`<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br/>
&lt;/script&gt;</body></html>
