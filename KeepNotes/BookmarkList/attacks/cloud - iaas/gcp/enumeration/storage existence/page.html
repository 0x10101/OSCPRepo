<title>Google Storage</title>
</head><body>Google Storage is a service that provides static file hosting within resources known as "buckets". The AWS S3 buckets and Google Storage buckets are similar across the two clouds. <br/>
<br/>
Google Storage bucket permission policies can get very fine-graned. <br/>
<br/>
One tool to help enumerate is [GCPBucketBrute](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCPBucketBrute) <br/>
<br/>
Instead of using "gsutil" (Google Storage Utility) CLI program, it was found to be a lot faster to hit each HTTP endpoint to check for existence. The tool will generate permutations based on keyword argument and make HEAD requests. <br/>
<br/>
Each HEAD request will be made to:<br/>
https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/BUCKET_NAME<br/>
<br/>
Any HTTP code except for 404 or 400 is an indicator that the bucket exists. </body></html>
