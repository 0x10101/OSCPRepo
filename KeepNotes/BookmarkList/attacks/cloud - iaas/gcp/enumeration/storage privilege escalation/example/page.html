</head><body>One privilege escalation method requires the "storage.buckets.setIamPolicy" permission. <br/>
<br/>
A vulnerable bucket policy might look something like this:<br/>
{"bindings":[{"members":["allAuthenticatedUsers","projectEditor:my-test-project","projectOwner:my-test-project"],"role":"roles\/storage.legacyBucketOwner"},{"members":["projectViewer:my-test-project"],"role":"roles\/storage.legacyBucketReader"},{"members":["projectEditor:my-test-project","projectOwner:my-test-project"],"role":"roles\/storage.legacyObjectOwner"},{"members":["projectViewer:my-test-project"],"role":"roles\/storage.legacyObjectReader"}],"etag":"ROQ="}<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring most of what is defined in this policy, we can see that the “allAuthenticatedUsers” group is a member of the role “roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner”. If we look at what permissions that role is granted, we see the following:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>storage.buckets.get</li>
<li>storage.buckets.getIamPolicy</li>
<li>storage.buckets.setIamPolicy</li>
<li>storage.buckets.update</li>
<li>storage.objects.create</li>
<li>storage.objects.delete</li>
<li>storage.objects.list</li>
</ul>
<br/>
This means that we can read (storage.buckets.getIamPolicy) and write (storage.buckets.setIamPolicy) to the buckets policy and we can create, delete, and list objects within the bucket.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Note that we see the same information by visiting this URL: https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/BUCKET_NAME/iam/testPermissions?permissions=storage.buckets.delete&amp;permissions=storage.buckets.get&amp;permissions=storage.buckets.getIamPolicy&amp;permissions=storage.buckets.setIamPolicy&amp;permissions=storage.buckets.update&amp;permissions=storage.objects.create&amp;permissions=storage.objects.delete&amp;permissions=storage.objects.get&amp;permissions=storage.objects.list&amp;permissions=storage.objects.update<br/>
<br/>
(note that the “storage.objects.getIamPolicy” and “storage.objects.setIamPolicy” permissions are omitted because they will throw an error on any bucket that is setup to disable object-level permissions. For buckets that enable object-level permissions, those values can be included).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
If we look at the permissions granted by the Storage Admin role instead, we can see that it grants these privileges:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>firebase.projects.get</li>
<li>resourcemanager.projects.get</li>
<li>resourcemanager.projects.list</li>
<li>storage.buckets.create</li>
<li>storage.buckets.delete</li>
<li>storage.buckets.get</li>
<li>storage.buckets.getIamPolicy</li>
<li>storage.buckets.list</li>
<li>storage.buckets.setIamPolicy</li>
<li>storage.buckets.update</li>
<li>storage.objects.create</li>
<li>storage.objects.delete</li>
<li>storage.objects.get</li>
<li>storage.objects.getIamPolicy</li>
<li>storage.objects.list</li>
<li>storage.objects.setIamPolicy</li>
<li>storage.objects.update</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
There are more privileges granted to this role than the role “allAuthenticatedUsers” is a member of, so why don’t we change that?<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
With the “gsutil” Google Storage CLI program, we can run the following command to grant “allAuthenticatedUsers” access to the “Storage Admin” role, thus escalating the privileges we were granted to the bucket:<br/>
gsutil iam ch group:allAuthenticatedUsers:admin gs://BUCKET_NAME<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Now if we look at the bucket policy again, we can see the following added to it (because the “ch” command appends instead of overwrites to the policy):<br/>
{"members":["group:allAuthenticatedUsers"],"role":"roles\/storage.admin"} &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
And just like that, we have escalated our privileges from a Storage Legacy Bucket Owner to a Storage Admin on a bucket that we don’t even own!<br/>
<br/>
One of the main attractions to escalating from a LegacyBucketOwner to Storage Admin is the ability to use the “storage.buckets.delete” privilege. In theory, you could delete the bucket after escalating your privileges, then you could create the bucket in your own account to steal the name.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if we review the privileges we are granted with the TestIamPermissions API again, we see that a few extras are added from the new role we used. Note that not all the privileges allowed by that role will be listed when using the TestIamPermissions API (such as resourcemanager.projects.list) because not all the permissions are Google Storage specific permissions and aren’t supported by the API.<br/>
