<title>Storage Permissions</title>
</head><body>For any bucket that is discovered, the GCPBucketBrute tool will use the Google Storage TestIamPermissions API to determine what level of access (if any) we have to the target bucket. <br/>
<br/>
If credentials are passed into the script, results from both an authenticated and unauthenticated call will be displayed. <br/>
<br/>
We can check for the bucket's policy by making direct HTTP requests to:<br/>
https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/BUCKET_NAME/iam<br/>
<br/>
or use the gsutil CLI to run:<br/>
gsutil iam get gs://BUCKET_NAME<br/>
<br/>
We can check for the bucket's policy by making direct HTTP requests to:<br/>
https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/BUCKET_NAME/iam<br/>
<br/>
or use the gsutil CLI to run:<br/>
gsutil iam get gs://BUCKET_NAME<br/>
<br/>
if "allUsers" or "allAuthenticatedUsers" are allowed to read the bucket policy, we will receive a valid response. Else, access denied. <br/>
<br/>
Bucket policy is helpful, but requires the "storage.buckets.getIamPolicy" permission. We can test permissions explicity with the Google Storage "TestIamPermissions" API. If we supply a bucket name and list Google Storage permissions, it will respond with the permissions we (the user making the request) have on that bucket. This completely bypasses the requirement of viewing the policy, with the restriction we can only view permissions for users we are able to authenticate as. <br/>
<br/>
To determine what permissions we have on a bucket, we can make a request to a URL similar to: <br/>
https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/BUCKET_NAME/iam/testPermissions?permissions=storage.objects.list<br/>
<br/>
It will respond and let us know if we have the "storage.objects.list" permission on the "BUCKET_NAME". The permissions parameter can be passed multiple times to check multiple permissions at once, and the Google Storage Python library supports the test_iam_permissions API (even though "gsutil" does not). </body></html>
