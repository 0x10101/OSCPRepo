<title>Testing AssumeRole and UpdateAssumeRolePolicy</title>
</head><body>AssumeRole no longer works like it did initially (no longer verbose enough), but UpdateAssumeRolePolicy can be used in the same way AssumeRole did for assuming access to accounts. <br/>
<br/>
The new module based on UpdateAssumeRolePolicy works in much the same way as the AssumeRole module. Still included in Pacu. <br/>

<a href="https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/Security-Research/tree/master/tools/aws-pentest-tools/assume_role_enum">AWS 'AssumeRole' Enumeration Script</a>&nbsp;- 1100+ word wordlist. Script is capable to automatically assuming the discovered role and outputting the issues credentials. <br/>

Also included in <a href="https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu">Pacu</a>&nbsp;- The AWS exploitation framework. <br/>

Note: The keys used must have the “sts:AssumeRole” permission on any resource (*) to be able to assume a misconfigured role. Lacking this permission, roles can still be identified, but not assumed.</body></html>
