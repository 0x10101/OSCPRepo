<title>Keys in EC2 Instances</title>
</head><body><i>Extracting keys from an EC2 instance</i><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
EC2 is an elastic computing service as part of AWS which is similar in nature to virtual private servers. Whilst an attacker is unlikely to have raw access (e.g. console access) to an EC2 instance there is the possibility that an attacker could steal console access and then use that access to steal the AWS keys. <br/>
<br/>
Most organisations would realise that if an instance (or vps) is compromised to this level a significant impact has been caused by the attacker and would likely perform some action like flattening the instance and rebuilding it to prevent backdoors, etc, for being used â€“ however you should also consider that the keys may have been compromised.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
This could work, for example, in the case of a web application where a remote code execution vulnerability has been caused by a vulnerability. The attacker could access the Meta Service of AWS to pull the keys. The Instance Metadata Service has documentation here: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html</a><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
In short, the attacker, from the compromised instance, could access:<br/>
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ <br/>
<br/>
which would return the role and:<br/>
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<span style="color: #ff0000">role-name </span>&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
would return the keys. <br/>
<br/>

&nbsp;<br/>
Yep, that happens too:<br/>
