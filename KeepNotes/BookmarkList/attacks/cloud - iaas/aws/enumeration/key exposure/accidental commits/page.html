</head><body><i>Accidentally committing them </i><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
If you work with a versioning system like GIT there is the potential that keys will be committed to the repository and it’s not quite as simple as just uncommitting them, or overwriting them with another commit. I won’t go over how to remove keys from a commit because my recommendation would be: If you have disclosed keys by mistake, revoke them and issue new keys. If keys were disclosed to a party which is now deemed not-trust worthy, revoke them and issue new keys. If you wrote them down on a post-it note, revoke them and issue new keys.<br/>
