<title>S3 ACLs</title>
</head><body><b>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</b><br/>
S3 access control lists can be applied at the bucket level as well as at the object level. They support the following set of permissions:<br/>
<br/>
<b>READ</b><br/>
At the bucket level, this allows the grantee to list the objects in a bucket. At the object level, this allows the grantee to read the contents as well as the metadata of an object. <br/>
<br/>
<b>READ_ACP</b><br/>
At the bucket level, this allows the grantee to read the bucket’s access control list. At the object level, this allows the grantee to read the object’s access control list. <br/>
<br/>
<b>WRITE</b><br/>
At the bucket level, this allows the grantee to create, overwrite, and delete objects in a bucket.<br/>
<br/>
<b>WRITE_ACP</b><br/>
At the bucket level, this allows the grantee to set an ACL for a bucket. At the object level, this allows the grantee to set an ACL for an object.<br/>
<br/>
<b>FULL_CONTROL</b><br/>
At the bucket level, this is equivalent to granting the “READ”, “WRITE”, “READ_ACP”, and “WRITE_ACP” permissions to a grantee. At the object level, this is equivalent to granting the “READ”, “READ_ACP”, and “WRITE_ACP” permissions to a grantee.<br/>
