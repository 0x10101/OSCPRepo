<title>Enumeration</title>
</head><body>When it comes to Amazon Web Services, most people think of S3 bucket enumeration as the only option for unauthenticated recon against a target. It’s possible to enumerate IAM users and roles without any keys (or other inside knowledge) to a target account. This allows for information gathering that can potentially expose who is using the environment, what 3rd party services are being utilized, &nbsp;AWS services utilized, and more. This all happens without any logs (CloudTrail or otherwise) being created in the victim’s account.</body></html>
