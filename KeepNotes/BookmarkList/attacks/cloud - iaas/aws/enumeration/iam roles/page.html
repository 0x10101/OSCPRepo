<title>IAM Roles</title>
</head><body>AWS verbose error messages disclose whether a role exists or not, allowing us to enumerate role names. A user could produce an arbitrary number of requests, making this enumeration technique highly scalable. By running this attack through a fragmented set of nodes and accounts, an attacker can bypass any IP or account-based blocking that may be in effect.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Simply enumerating role names can reveal:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>which AWS services a company is using internally</li>
<li>internal software/stacks</li>
<li>names of IAM users (to target for social engineering)</li>
<li>3rd party integrations being used (which could potentially be targeted separately) </li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>&nbsp;A few common integrations we have observed include CloudSploit, Okta, and Datadog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br/>
Once roles are enumerated, one can try to assume any open roles and pilfer the role credentials.<br/>
<br/>
If you try to assume a role that you <b>don’t</b>&nbsp;have permissions to, AWS will output an error similar to:<br/>
An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the AssumeRole operation: User: arn:aws:iam::012345678901:user/MyUser is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/aws-service-role/rds.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForRDS<br/>
<br/>
This error message indicates that the role exists, but its assume role policy document does not allow you to assume it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By running the same command, but targeting a role that <b>does not exist</b>, AWS will return:<br/>
An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the AssumeRole operation: Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRole<br/>
<br/>
Surprisingly, this process <b>works cross-account</b>. Given any valid AWS account ID and a well-tailored wordlist, you can enumerate the account’s existing roles without restrictions.<br/>
