<title>AssumeRole</title>
</head><body>The AssumeRole permissions are very flexible and, if misconfigured, could lead to unintended consequences. &nbsp;For example, if the access role “AWS”: “*” is associated and any user from any account may be able to assume the role (given that they have the correct AWS Account ID and Role Name).<br/>

<b>Testing AssumeRole - Enumerating if Roles Exist (and potentially assume that role)</b><br/>

Script is capable to automatically assuming the discovered role and outputting the issues credentials. <br/>

Note: The keys used must have the “sts:AssumeRole” permission on any resource (*) to be able to assume a misconfigured role. Lacking this permission, roles can still be identified, but not assumed.<br/>
