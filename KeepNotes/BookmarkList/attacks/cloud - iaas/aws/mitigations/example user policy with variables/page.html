<title>Example User Policy With Variables</title>
</head><body>By using the “aws:username” variable, it is possible to give users a variety of IAM permissions that they can only execute against themselves. Examples of permissions you would want to use this variable in the resource for include aws:CreateAccessKey (method #4), aws:CreateLoginProfile (method #5), and aws:UpdateLoginProfile (method #6). Included in this list should be permissions relating to setting up (not deleting/removing) multi-factor authentication for the current user account. By giving an IAM user all of these permissions but restricting them to only being allowed to be run on the current user, a user can create their own login profile/password, change their own password, create themselves a new set of access keys, and setup multi-factor authentication for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
A policy like that might look like the following:<br/>
<br/>
{<br/>
“Version”: “2012-10-17”,<br/>
“Statement”: [{<br/>
“Action”: [<br/>
“iam:CreateAccessKey”,<br/>
“iam:CreateLoginProfile”,<br/>
“iam:UpdateLoginProfile”,<br/>
“iam:CreateVirtualMFADevice”<br/>
],<br/>
“Effect”: “Allow”,<br/>
“Resource”: [“arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:user/${aws:username}”]<br/>
}]<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now for any user that this policy is attached to, they can only perform those four actions on themselves, because of the user of the “aws:username” variables. This example policy shows how to correctly format those variables to be recognized correctly by IAM, which is done by putting the IAM variable name inside curly-brackets that begin with a money sign (${example-variable}).<br/>
<br/>
To restrict access to a certain IP address, the IAM policy must user the “Condition” key to set a condition that the IAM user is allowed to perform these actions, if and only if this condition is set. The following IAM policy document snippet shows “Condition” being used to restrict access to only those users who run API calls after a certain time (2013-08-16T12:00:00Z), before another time (2013-08-16T15:00:00Z) and having an IP address originating from a certain CIDR range (192.0.2.0/24 or 203.0.113.0/24).<br/>
<br/>
“Condition” : &nbsp;{<br/>
“DateGreaterThan” : {<br/>
“aws:CurrentTime” : “2013-08-16T12:00:00Z”<br/>
},<br/>
“DateLessThan”: {<br/>
“aws:CurrentTime” : “2013-08-16T15:00:00Z”<br/>
},<br/>
“IpAddress” : {<br/>
“aws:SourceIp” : [“192.0.2.0/24”, “203.0.113.0/24”]<br/>
}<br/>
}<br/>
