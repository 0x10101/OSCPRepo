<title>Defending Buckets</title>
</head><body>There are two ways to lock down your S3 buckets: the user friendly <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html">Access Control List (ACL)</a>&nbsp;and a less user friendly <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html">Bucket Policy</a>. The ACL (Figure 1) is going to be familiar to anyone who has looked at a Windows NTFS ACL. It allows you to specify access controls for specific AWS users, any authenticated AWS user, and everyone (i.e., any user on the internet). The default settings are the owner having read/write to both object access and permissions access, objects being files stored in the bucket and permissions being the ACLs themselves. With permissions access you can read/write the bucket’s ACL! This is a good place to start any S3 bucket audits. <br/>

<br/>
The Bucket Policy is much more involved, but provides much more granularity by using a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html">JSON-based access policy language</a>. Figure 2 is an example of what this looks like. The Bucket Policy allows you to specify permissions and conditions to apply to specific resources and principals. An example of the granularity by the Bucket Policy compared to using the ACLs is that ACL write access provides create, overwrite, and delete permissions. In the Bucket Policy, you assign those rights individually using DeleteObject and PutObject. <br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
I recommend: &nbsp;<br/>
<b>Ignoring the ACL and using the Bucket Policy for any granted access</b>. The main reason for this is granularity. For example, if you want to provide read access to objects to everyone, using the ACL also gives them the ability to list all objects in your bucket. With the Bucket Policy, you can give only GetObject permissions to everyone, so they must have the exact URL to access objects. <br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Exercising the Principle of Least Access.  </b>Provide access to objects ONLY as required by your business needs. Does everyone need to access this data? Does it make sense to limit access to corporate IP addresses? Who specifically needs the ability to list objects in your bucket outside of the AWS console?<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Testing your access controls. </b>Spot-checking changes you have made to bucket permissions is the right thing to do. Double-check your changes to make sure you haven’t opened up access to Everyone by accident. Test access as an anonymous use and as an authenticated AWS user not in your organization. Review your Bucket Policies. Curl a sample of bucket objects periodically to make sure things are in order. <br/>
