<title>AWS Metadata Service</title>
</head><body>In the past, developers used hard-coded passwords to access different services, such as MySQL or FTP, to retrieve client data. Amazon realized this poor security practice and implemented what is called the Amazon Metadata Service. Instead, when your application wants to access assets, it can query the metadata service to get a set of temporary access credentials. The temporary credentials can then be used to access your S3 assets and other services. Another purpose of this metadata service is to store the user data supplied when launching your instance, in-turn configuring your application as it launches.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;“Although you can only access instance metadata and user data from within the instance itself, the data is not protected by cryptographic methods."<br/>
<br/>
<b>AWS “Metadata Service” Attack Surface &nbsp;</b><br/>
From the attacker’s perspective, this metadata service is one of the juiciest services on AWS to access. The implications of being able to access it from the application could yield total control if the application is running under the root IAM account, but at the very least give you a set of valid AWS credentials to interface with the API.<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
Developers often overlook putting sensitive information into the user startup scripts. User startup scripts can be accessed through the metadata service and allow EC2 instances to be spun up with certain configurations. Often times this is overlooked, and some startup scripts will contain usernames and passwords used to access various services. When assessing a web application, look for functionality that fetches page data and returns it back to the end user much like a proxy would. Since the metadata service doesn’t require any particular parameters, fetching the URL <i>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/IAM_USER_ROLE_HERE</i>&nbsp;will return the AccessKeyID, SecretAccessKey, and Token you need to authenticate into the account. &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Using the tool <a href="https://github.com/andresriancho/nimbostratus">nimbostratus developed by Andres Riancho</a>, we can now assess what the credentials we obtained can access. Andres’s nimbostratus presentation – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NF4LjjwoZw">found here</a>&nbsp;– demonstrates how AWS infrastructure operates and how this tool helped him further his engagement. To view the permissions of your access keys, first configure your own AWS CLI with the following command: &nbsp;<br/>
aws configure<br/>
<br/>
Then run<br/>
./nimbostratus -v dump-permissions --access-key &lt;&gt; --secret-key &lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Best case scenario, the script will tell you that you have obtained a root account and officially have keys to the Amazon kingdom. At the very least, the script will detail your precise level of access to the AWS account. I won’t reveal all the capabilities here as Mr. Riancho covers it well in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NF4LjjwoZw">his talk</a>, but if you’re doing an assessment involving AWS infrastructure, it is well worth the view. &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
If unable to obtain a root account, the next best thing is access to the IAM resource. If you have permissions to create IAM users but cannot access the EC2 resource, you can create a new IAM user through Python’s boto3 library or the command line. This method grants an attacker access to the missing EC2 security credentials and once again; you have the keys to the kingdom. Moreover, you can update login profiles and passwords without verifying old credentials, allowing you to gain access to the AWS administration panel. IAM users can be extremely diverse in their privilege levels making it appealing from a security perspective, but default implementations and misconfigurations can lead critical vulnerabilities.</body></html>
