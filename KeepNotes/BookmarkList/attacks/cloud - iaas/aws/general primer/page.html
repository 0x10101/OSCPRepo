</head><body>When penetration testing Amazon Web Services (AWS) environments there are different perspectives the assessment could consider, some are very similar to external infrastructure/web application assessments and some are different.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
I’ll separate the things that are the same from the things that are different to traditional penetration testing by considering the following types of cloud testing and then breaking each one down into the kinds of testing that could take place:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;<b>Testing on the Cloud:</b>&nbsp;testing traditional system which are simply hosted within a cloud environment. For example, this can be virtualised systems that have been moved from on-premises to the cloud (e.g. “lift and shift”) or it could be web applications which are hosted on the cloud where only the applications themselves are considered in scope for the assessment and not the supporting infrastructure.</li>
<li><b>Testing in the Cloud: </b>testing systems within the cloud that are not exposed publicly, this for example could be testing the server hosting an application or for example, testing systems which are hosted on the cloud but have a firewall preventing direct access and are instead accessed through a bastion host (e.g. a private VPC). Additionally we would consider the risks associated with a compromised application that allows an attacker access to the backend infrastructure.</li>
<li><b>Testing the Cloud Console: </b>testing the configuration of the cloud console (sometimes referred to as the portal) itself, such as looking at the user accounts which have been set up, their permissions, the access-control lists which have been configured, etc. This is effectively a configuration review and could well be compliance driven – however there are still several things in this category to consider as a penetration tester in case access to a cloud console is gained during a penetration test. It’s also most likely an efficient way to determine potential paths of privilege escalation.<b> </b></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br/>
Don’t forget that you’ll need permission from Amazon as well as the company who own the application to perform testing activity. Penetration Testing of Amazon hosted services has obviously been conducted before, therefore Amazon have a well-documented process for informing them when testing activity is going to take place, which systems you are authorised to perform penetration testing against, and appropriate terms of service and rules of engagement.
