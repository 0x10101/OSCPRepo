<title>Shadow Admins</title>
</head><body>AWS allows granular configuration of Identity and Access Management (IAM). You can restrict the permissions a user has to quite a fine degree, however there are certain permissions which potentially allow a greater level of access than you might realise.<br/>
<br/>
In short, there are many permissions sets which given certain restrictions can allow for privilege escalation within AWS environments.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;If you consider the situation where an administrator is setting up an account and then once everything is working hardening that account, it would not be a stretch to expect the administrator to give more permissions than are necessary initially and then tune the permissions of that account down to follow the principle of lease privilege. If a policy the attacker has access to has a higher level of permissions, but they have access to set the default policy version they can simply change which version is in use. This kind of issue is obviously highly contextual to the specific set up your environment has and RhinoLabs gives 17 such possible privilege escalation methods – so it’s certainly worth reviewing them! &nbsp;<br/>

There are tools to help audit the configuration of the AWS Console such as ScoutSuite. </body></html>
