<title>Testing the Cloud Console</title>
</head><body>Finally, by testing the cloud itself, I am referring to connecting to the AWS Console to take a look at the security of the configuration of the console. Really this is configuration review type activities but itâ€™s worth taking a brief look at here, as an attacker could potentially compromise an account with access and it gives an introduction to look at a few of the vulnerabilities that exist and the security features amazon has provided.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The first thing to say, in regards to an attacker compromising an account with access to the AWS Console is that accounts can be configured to require multifactor authentication (MFA; sometimes referred to as two-factor authentication or 2FA). There are quite a number of MFA options for AWS, it can also be used for controlling access to the console and access to AWS APIs. More details are available here: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/">https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/</a><br/>
