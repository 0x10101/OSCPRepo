<title>TrustedAdvisor</title>
</head><body><b>AWS TrustedAdvisor – </b><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/</a>&nbsp;– is a system which gives recommendations in several categories, but of course it’s tiered so there’s “core” and “full” depending on if you’re on a standard, business, or enterprise plan (the latter two get “full” access). It gives recommendations on how to improve your environment in categories such as: security, cost optimisation, performance, and fault tolerance. Nicely they actually expose all of the checks each level and category provide (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/best-practices/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/best-practices/</a>), so for example under security we have things such as: security groups with unrestricted access, unrestricted access to systems to specific network ports, missing MFA on the root account, IAM password policy, etc. &nbsp;</body></html>
