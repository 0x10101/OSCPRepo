</head><body><b>AWS Inspector – </b><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/">https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/</a>&nbsp;– is an automated security assessment service for application deployed within AWS. If you’d like to try it out there is a 90 day trial of up to 250 agent-assessments. IT finds issues such as insecure protocols, software running without DEP, software without stack cookies, root processes – but it requires an agent to be installed to use. &nbsp;</body></html>
