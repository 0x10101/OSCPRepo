<title>Mitigation</title>
</head><body>While this username enumeration vector is low risk in itself – most useful as part of a larger campaign – the underlying issue lies in AWS’ verbose error messaging, so all AWS users are affected.<br/>
Even so, we’ve included an option in the &nbsp;iam_user_enum script to help gauge your susceptibility to IAM attacks. &nbsp;Run the “—self-check” option to pull all usernames for the associated account and if they have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled.<br/>
<br/>
This security mechanism ensures that even if IAM usernames are enumerated and passwords are compromised, there’s a second authentication check to prevent account hijacking. &nbsp;2FA is highly recommended for all AWS users, if not already enabled.</body></html>
