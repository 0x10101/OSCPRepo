<title>Privilege Escalation</title>
</head><body><b>Why is this Important?</b><br/>
Cloud privilege escalation and IAM permission misconfigurations have been discussed in the past, but most posts and tools only offer ‘best practices’ and not context on what’s actually exploitable.<br/>
<br/>
By documenting specific combinations of weak permissions that could lead to compromise, we aim to help highlight these risks and bring awareness to ways API permissions can be abused.<br/>

<b>Specific AWS Escalation Methods &nbsp;</b><br/>
Here we get into the full list of identified escalation methods, as well as a description and potential impact for each.<br/>
