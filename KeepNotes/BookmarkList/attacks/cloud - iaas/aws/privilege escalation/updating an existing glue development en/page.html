<title>Updating an Existing Glue Development Endpoint</title>
</head><body><b>Description: </b>An attacker with the <u>glue:UpdateDevEndpoint</u>&nbsp;permission would be able to update the associated SSH public key of an existing Glue development endpoint, to then SSH into it and have access to the permissions the attached role has access to.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
An example command to exploit this method might look like this:<br/>
<i>aws glue –endpoint-name target_endpoint –public-key file://path/to/my/public/ssh/key.pub</i><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Now the attacker would just need to SSH into the development endpoint to access the roles credentials. Like method number 14, even though it is not specifically noted in the GuardDuty documentation, it would be a bad idea to exfiltrate the credentials from the Glue Instance. Instead, the AWS API should be accessed directly from the new instance.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Potential Impact: </b>This would give an attacker access to the privileges associated with the role attached to the specific Glue development endpoint, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.<br/>
