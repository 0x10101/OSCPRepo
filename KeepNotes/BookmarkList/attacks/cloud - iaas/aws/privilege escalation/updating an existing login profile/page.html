<title>Updating an Existing Login Profile</title>
</head><body><b>Description: </b>An attacker with the <u>iam:UpdateLoginProfile</u>&nbsp;permission on other users can change the password used to login to the AWS console on any user that already has a login profile setup.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Like creating a login profile, an example command to exploit this method might look like this:<br/>
<i>aws iam update-login-profile –user-name target_user –password ‘|[3rxYGGl3@`~68)O{,-$1B”zKejZZ.X1;6T}&lt;XT5isoE=LB2L^G@{uK&gt;f;/CQQeXSo&gt;}th)KZ7v?\\hq.#@dh49″=fT;|,lyTKOLG7J[qH$LV5U&lt;9`O~Z”,jJ[iT-D^(‘ –no-password-reset-required</i><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Where target_user has an extended set of permissions compared to the current user and the password is the max possible length (128 characters) with all types of characters (symbols, lowercase, uppercase, numbers) so that you can guarantee that it will meet the accounts minimum password requirements.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Potential Impact: </b>This method would give an attacker the same level of permissions as any user they were able to update the login profile for, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.<br/>
