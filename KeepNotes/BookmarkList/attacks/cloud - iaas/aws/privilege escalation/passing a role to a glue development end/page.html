<title>Passing a Role to a Glue Development Endpoint</title>
</head><body><b>Description: </b>An attacker with the <u>iam:PassRole</u>&nbsp;and <u>glue:CreateDevEndpoint</u>&nbsp;permissions could create a new AWS Glue development endpoint and pass an existing service role to it. They then could SSH into the instance and use the AWS CLI to have access of the permissions the role has access to.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
An example command to exploit this method might look like this:<br/>
<i>aws glue create-dev-endpoint –endpoint-name my_dev_endpoint –role-arn arn_of_glue_service_role –public-key file://path/to/my/public/ssh/key.pub</i><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Now the attacker would just need to SSH into the development endpoint to access the roles credentials. Even though it is not specifically noted in the GuardDuty documentation, like method number 2 (Creating an EC2 instance with an existing instance profile), it would be a bad idea to exfiltrate the credentials from the Glue Instance. Instead, the AWS API should be accessed directly from the new instance.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Potential Impact: </b>This would give an attacker access to the privileges associated with any Glue service role that exists in the account, which could range from no privilege escalation to full administrator access to the account.<br/>
