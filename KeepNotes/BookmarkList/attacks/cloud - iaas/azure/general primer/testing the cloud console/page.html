<title>Testing the Cloud Console</title>
</head><body><br/>
Finally, by testing the cloud itself, I am referring to connecting to the Azure Portal and taking a look at the security of the configuration of the console. However, remember that the portal is used for ARM and that ASM had the “Classic Portal”. As of January 8 2018 the classic portal has been “sunsetted” and the old address <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com/">https://manage.windowsazure.com/</a>&nbsp;will simply redirect to the new address <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">https://portal.azure.com/</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
With full access to all aspects of the Azure environment it is possible to perform a full security review, which would likely work more like a “configuration review”. It’s sensible to start with basic things such as checking accounts for lack-of-MFA, determining how secrets are stored within the environment, and by finding weak network security groups (NSG). If you’ve not come across NSG before, they’re effectively firewall filters.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
I’ll run through some of the security features of Azure which should be considered. Additionally, it’s worth taking a look at Azurite (<a href="https://github.com/mwrlabs/Azurite">here</a>) which assists in the enumeration and visualisation of an Azure environment and may assist a security review. Azurite is not to be confused with Azurite, the first being an enumeration tool written by MWR as previously mentioned and the latter being a tool written by Microsoft as a clone of Azure server storage (<a href="https://github.com/Azure/Azurite">here</a>).<br/>
