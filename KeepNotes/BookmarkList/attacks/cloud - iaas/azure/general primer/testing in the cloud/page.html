<title>Testing in the Cloud</title>
</head><body><br/>
As with my AWS article, by “testing in the cloud” I mean effectively having the perspective of a system running within the customer’s cloud environment, such as a compromised web server.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Here it’s likely a good idea to introduce the Azure Deployment Models. Really there is the old model and the new model. These models control how systems are deployed into an Azure environment. The legacy model is known as “Azure Service Management” (sometimes called “Azure Classic”, or ASM) and the new system is known as “Azure Resource Manager” (ARM) which includes role-based access control. The previous ASM portal (“Classic Portal”) was shut down on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/updates/azure-portal-updates-for-classic-portal-users/">8th January 2018</a>.  however you will still see many references to it in Microsoft Documentation. If you’re torn apart by curiosity to lean about ASM then information can be found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model">here</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The simplest kinds of testing you could do would be to deploy a scanning engine into the environment to allow for vulnerability scans. With Amazon there is Amazon Machine Images which allows for scanners to be downloaded – there’s an equivalent in Azure, if you log in to your Azure Portal and take a look in the Marketplace you can find scanners such as <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/rapid7.nexpose-scan-engine?tab=Overview">Nexpose</a>, <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/qualysguard.qualys-virtual-scanner-v24?tab=Overview">Qualys</a>, or <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/tenable.tenablecorenessus?tab=Overview">Nessus</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Testing in the cloud could be achieved where a system is compromised during a Penetration Test (such as a web server being vulnerable to command injection) or it may be provided by a client to allow testing of this eventuality to take place without the prerequisite vulnerability.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
A Penetration Tester could be given secure access to an instance within the environment, or alternatively access can be granted by means of a VPN to allow access more directly. The number of deployed systems, complexity of the environment, and desired level of assurance will likely dictate which is the best approach. Testing with this type of context is likely going to be similar for a Penetration Tester as an internal corporate network, including known weaknesses such as servers with remote desktop protocol (terminal services) exposed with self-signed certificates.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Previously under ASM it was possible to authenticated using “Management Certificates”, under the newer ARM these have been replaced with “Service Principals” however I will explain both here.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Whilst access may be granted through a username and password (and hopefully <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks">multi-factor authentication</a>!) it’s possible to grant access to ASM (that’s the legacy one we talked about earlier) through Management Certificates. These certificates could be contained within files such as .pfx and .cspkg. If you’re unfamiliar with these a PFX file is a PKCS#12 archive which (may be password protected and) may contain a private key. A CSPKG file is a cloud services package which is effectively a zip file created by Visual Studio to allow applications to be deployed to Azure, however they may contain management certificates.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The newer ARM does not use Management Certificates but instead users service principals. Service Principals are more like Service Accounts for on-premises deployments and do not allow portal access but allow more restricted access to resources, authenticating as a service principal can be configured to be done either by username and password, or by certificate. If during a Penetration Test you find yourself some service principal credentials lying around, take a look here for information about authenticating with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps?view=azurermps-6.5.0#sign-in-with-a-service-principal">them</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
In short, it can be achieved with powershell such as:<br/>
&nbsp;$pscredential = Get-Credential Connect-AzureRmAccount -ServicePrincipal -ApplicationId "http://my-app" -Credential $pscredential -TenantId $tenantid <br/>
