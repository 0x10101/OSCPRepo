<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>I’ll separate the things that are the same from the things that are different to traditional penetration testing by considering the following types of cloud testing and then breaking each one down into the kinds of testing that could take place:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;<b>Testing on the Cloud:</b> testing traditional system which are simply hosted within a cloud environment. For example, this can be virtualised systems that have been moved from on-premises to the cloud (e.g. “lift and shift”) or it could be web applications which are hosted on the cloud where only the applications themselves are considered in scope for the assessment and not the supporting infrastructure.</li>
<li><b>Testing in the Cloud: </b>testing systems within the cloud that are not exposed publicly, this for example could be testing the server hosting an application or for example, testing systems which are hosted on the cloud but have a firewall preventing direct access and are instead accessed through a bastion host. Additionally we would consider the risks associated with a compromised application that allows an attacker access to the backend infrastructure.</li>
<li><b>Testing the Cloud Console: </b>testing the configuration of the cloud console (sometimes referred to as the portal) itself, such as looking at the user accounts which have been set up, their permissions, the access-control lists which have been configured, etc. This is effectively a configuration review and could well be compliance driven – however there are still several things in this category to consider as a penetration tester in case access to a cloud console is gained during a penetration test. It’s also most likely an efficient way to determine potential paths of privilege escalation.<b> </b></li>
</ul>

The first difference you would notice, if reading the AWS article and this one side-by-side, is that Microsoft no longer requires prior approval for Penetration Testing activity. That’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-pen-testing">documented here</a>. However you are still “encouraged” to notify Microsoft, but it’s not a requirement, and of course <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-pen-testing">there are still rules of engagement</a>. The rules of engagement restrict the types of things you would expect – for example, denial-of-service testing is forbidden, as is attempting to access data that does is not wholly your own. There are a few areas which you might be surprised that Microsoft “encourages”, such as: attempting to break out of a shared service container, and load testing your application.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
For the first, Microsoft sets the limitation on if you are successful in breaking out of a shared service container you must stop testing immediately and report the success to Microsoft. For the latter, Microsoft differentiations here between “load-testing” and “denial-of-service” attacks. Further explanation states that by this, they mean testing surge capacity is acceptable whereas aiming to degrade the services of others of impact assets outside of your own environment is not. <i>Still not a lawyer, terms and conditions still apply, and of course no batteries are ever included.</i><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Microsoft also notes that they perform their own Penetration Testing and Red Teaming of their cloud infrastructure, services , and applications, <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Cloud-Red-Teaming-b837392e">as documented here</a>.<br/>
