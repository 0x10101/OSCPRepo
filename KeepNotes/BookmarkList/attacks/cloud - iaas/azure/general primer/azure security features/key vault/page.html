</head><body><b>Key Vault</b>&nbsp;– <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/key-vault/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/key-vault/</a>&nbsp;– is a feature to encrypt keys and passwords within a hardware security module. It can even handle requesting and renewing TLS certificates. Authentication is handled by Active Directory. It is designed in such a way that Microsoft cannot access the keys in storage. &nbsp;</body></html>
