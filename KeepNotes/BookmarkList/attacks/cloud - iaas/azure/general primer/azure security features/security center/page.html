<title>Security Center</title>
</head><body><b>Azure Security Center – </b><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/security-center/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/security-center/</a>&nbsp;– announces itself as “unified security management and advanced threat protection across hybrid cloud workloads” which sounds really good but what is it? It’s an agent based security tool which works on Windows and Linux. It looks for security features which are not enabled as well as enforcing security policies, enforcing application whitelisting (with enforcement or audit modes), flag missing features such as WAF not enabled, NSG not enabled, missing operating system updates. &nbsp;</body></html>
