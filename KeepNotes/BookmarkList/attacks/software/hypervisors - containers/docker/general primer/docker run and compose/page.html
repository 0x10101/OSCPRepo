“Sometimes you have to do it wrong a few times before you learn enough to know what the right way is. Or just read the docs, yeah, that would definitely be easier.” This is the an example of a truncated Docker Compose file showing a single service. Additional services would be listed below it, 13 in my case at the time of writing.<br/>
<br/>
All of the Docker components are structured in a yaml file. To implement the compose file execute docker-compose up -d in the directory of the file. Docker will then apply that config and getting it running to that state. Any time Docker Compose is run after, Docker will apply whatever state is specified in the compose file, even if it requires recreating the container. I would recommend this method if you want granular control and to take advantage of the idempotency Docker Compose has to offer.<br/>

<b>Docker Run - One-off’s And Testing</b><br/>
<br/>
$ docker run -d --name=gawebserver \<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; --restart on-failure \<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -v ${CONFIGDIR}/gawebserver/config:/config \<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -v ${CONFIGDIR}/gawebserver/assistant:/root/.config/google-assistant-library/assistant \<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -p 9324:9324 \<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -p 5000:5000 \<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -e CLIENT_SECRET=client_secret.json \<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -e DEVICE_MODEL_ID=device_model_id \<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; -e PROJECT_ID=project_id \<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; --device /dev/snd:/dev/snd:rwm \<br/>

Above is an example of a Docker Run command in bash. I figured out that I could use these one off commands to run containers not supported by DockSTARTer. Once running then using the standard Docker commands to administer them docker [ pull start stop restart exec logs ps ]. Later I ended up with a list of all the Docker Run commands I could execute to get my environment up and running saved in a file. Separating myself from DockSTARTer and giving me more parameter control. After moving over to Docker Compose I believe Docker Run is still useful for running one off containers or testing.<br/>

Need to convert Docker Run commands to a Docker Compose file? Use composerize.com It’ll convert it for you speeding up the Docker Compose file creation.<br/>
