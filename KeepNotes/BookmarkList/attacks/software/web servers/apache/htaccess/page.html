<title>.htaccess</title>
</head><body>.htaccess is a configuration file for use on web servers running the Apache Web Server software. When a .htaccess file is placed in a directory which is in turn 'loaded via the Apache Web Server', then the .htaccess file is detected and executed by the Apache Web Server software. These .htaccess files can be used to alter the configuration of the Apache Web Server software to enable/disable additional functionality and features that the Apache Web Server software has to offer. These facilities include basic redirect functionality, for instance if a 404 file not found error occurs, or for more advanced functions such as content password protection or image hot link prevention. &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Where is the .htaccess file?<br/>
In theory, every folder (directory) on your server could have one. Generally, though, there is one in your web root folder — that’s the folder that holds all the content of your website, and is usually labeled something like Public_HTML or www.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a single directory that contains multiple website subdirectories, there will usually be an .htaccess file in the main root (Public_HTML) directory and also one in each subdirectory (/sitename).<br/>
