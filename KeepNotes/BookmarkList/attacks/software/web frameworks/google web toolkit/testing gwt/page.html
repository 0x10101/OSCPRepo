<title>Testing GWT</title>
</head><body>Client-side code is obfuscated by default<br/>
RPC request payloads are serialized in a custom format<br/>
Dynamic web app scanners do not correctly test GWT-RPC requests<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tooling:<br/>
[GWTEnum](http://www.gdssecurity.com/l/t) | Automates GWT-RPC enumeration. Downloads {HEX}.cache.html and uses regex to enumerate methods<br/>
[GWTParse](http://www.gdssecurity.com/l/t) | Parses GWT-RPC request and identifies user input. Only works for serialization version 5 (and specific data types)<br/>
[GWT-Penetration-Testing-Toolset](https://github.com/GDSSecurity/GWT-Penetration-Testing-Toolset/issues) | A set of tools made to assist in penetration testing GWT applications. Additional details about these tools can be found on my OWASP Appsec DC slides available here: <a href="http://www.owasp.org/images/7/77/Attacking_Google_Web_Toolkit.ppt">http://www.owasp.org/images/7/77/Attacking_Google_Web_Toolkit.ppt</a>&nbsp; Seems to have a lot of issues with newer versions (no updates since 2012)<br/>
[gwt.py](https://github.com/sourceincite/tools/blob/master/gwt.py) | tool to enum methods and generate GWT requests from NON-obfuscated GWT calls. <br/>
[gwt-3d](https://github.com/miaouPlop/GWT-3D) | "updated" version of GDSSecurity's toolset <br/>

<b>Recon, what to look for?</b><br/>
Admin methods<br/>
Un-Called methods<br/>
Unauthenticated (direct) access to methods<ul><li>Are the {HEX}.cache.html files accessible by unauthenticated users?</li>
<li>Is the login functionality implemented using GWT RPC?</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>If yes, the {HEX}.cache.html file will be leaking out information to unauthenticated users!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Attacking GWT</b><ul><li>GWT RPC services are vulnerable to the same type of server-side vulnerabilities as typical web apps.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Ex. SQL Injection, Path Manipulation, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How about vulnerabilities that affect the browser like Cross-Site Scripting?</li>
<li>Do GWT requests contain CSRF protection?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>GWT XSS</b><ul><li>CSRF protection prevents most GWT applications from being vulnerable to reflected XSS</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Can still be vulnerable if application is not using GWT RPC</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GWT applications are still be vulnerable to stored XSS</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The GWT client API provide ways to render HTML within widgets (setInnerHTML, setHTML, and HTML constructor) <br/>
<br/>
<b>DOM XSS</b><ul><li>While injecting SCRIPT tags may not lead to successful XSS, injecting a STYLE tag with the onload attribute may</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Fuzzing</b><br/>
Fuzzing all pipe delimited values creates too much output!<br/>
The correct way to fuzz GWT requests is to identify user input and its data type<br/>
Numeric values should not be tested for string related issues<br/>
<br/>
The first four values of the payload can be expected to appear in every GWT RPC request. The first two values consist of the directory containing all the Javascript that was generated during the GWT compiliation and what looks to be an identifier for the Service. Regardless of their meanings, their contents should not be fuzzed as the values are not taken into consideration by the server. <br/>
