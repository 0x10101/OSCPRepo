<title>Calculating Serialization Policy</title>
</head><body><b>How is a serialization policy calculated?</b><br/>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/source/browse/trunk/user/src/com/google/gwt/user/rebind/rpc/SerializableTypeOracleBuilder.java">SerializationTypeOracleBuilder</a>&nbsp;determines whether a type is serializable or not. This builder is run twice for each RPC stub, to calculate the types that may potentially be sent in each direction.<br/>
The results from the two SerializationTypeOracles are combined into a single text file, its MD5 hash is taken to get the strong name, and it's written to disk.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Arrays</b><br/>
GWT generates code to handle covariant arrays. For example, suppose an RPC call uses an array type such as Foo[][], and Foo has subtype Bar. Then GWT will generate code supporting the following array types: Foo[][], Foo[], Bar[][], Bar[]. This is to allow for covariant arrays. So if an array has rank R there are S instantiable subtypes (including the root), the number of array types generated is R*S.<br/>
<br/>
Note that covariant arrays are also generated for fields of type List&lt;Foo&gt;, because an array of type Foo[] could be wrapped via Arrays.asList(). If you don't want this, you should use an ArrayList, which has a custom field serializer.<br/>
<br/>
It's slightly more complicated if not all subtypes of Foo are instantiable. If Baz is a subtype of Foo that isn't instantiable for some reason, then the array type for Baz will be generated only if Baz has a subtype that's instantiable. (For example, this could happen if Baz is abstract or has no zero-arg constructor.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Custom Serializers</b><br/>
If a type has a custom serializer, its hash will be calculated using the fields on the serializer class instead of on the original class. (See <a href="https://gwt.googlesource.com/gwt/+/release/2.6/user/src/com/google/gwt/user/server/rpc/impl/SerializabilityUtil.java">SerializabilityUtil.java</a>&nbsp;line 895.) It may be useful to add a dummy field on the serializer and change its name if the custom serializer's protocol changes.</body></html>
