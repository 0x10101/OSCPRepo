<title>Serialization Policies</title>
</head><body>A GWT-RPC serialization policy controls whether each Java type is whitelisted for serialization or deserialization over GWT-RPC. (This is from the server's point of view; deserialization happens for request parameters and serialization for objects returned or thrown.) GWT-RPC supports two levels of serializability:<br/>
<ul><li>Field-serializable means that the fields of the class may be serialized.</li>
<li>Instantiable means that in addition, a new instance of the class may be created.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
For example, in the Validation sample app, the RPC call may throw NumberFormatException, so this type is both field-serializable and instantiable for the serialization direction. NumberFormatException inherits from RuntimeException and Throwable but they're never thrown directly, so these classes have field serialization turned on but aren't instantiable.<br/>
