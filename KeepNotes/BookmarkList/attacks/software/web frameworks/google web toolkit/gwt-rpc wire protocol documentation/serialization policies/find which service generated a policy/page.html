<title>Find Which Service Generated A Policy</title>
</head><body><b>How can I find out which GWT-RPC service generated a policy?</b><br/>
The GWT compiler writes output to two directories, controlled by the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCompilingAndDebugging#DevGuideCompilerOptions">-deploy and -extra flags</a>.<br/>
In the extra directory, there is a file named rpcPolicyManifest/manifest.txt that has the mapping from RPC services to policy files. For example, the validation sample app generates this file:<br/>
<br/>
# Module validation<br/>
# RPC service class, partial path of RPC policy file<br/>
com.google.gwt.sample.validation.client.GreetingService, D031DD0CECD85E06AF1E383A0EC73E6E.gwt.rpc<br/>
<br/>
There is also a directory named "manifests/" which contains a file for each mapping, in a somewhat more machine-readable format. (The filenames in this directory are meaningless; they're just the MD5 of the contents.)<br/>
