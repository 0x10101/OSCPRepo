<title>How Many Policies Per GWT App</title>
</head><body><b>How many serialization policies does a GWT app have?</b><br/>
The worst case is quite large:<br/>
&nbsp;permutations = supported browsers * locales<br/>
&nbsp;policies = permutations * GWT-RPC services<br/>
<br/>
However, normally GWT-RPC services don't use any types that are specific to a browser or locale. In that case, each permutation should generate an identical serialization policy for a given service and so there's one policy per service.<br/>
<br/>
If for any reason the serialization policies turn out to be different for each permutation, this can cause server-side memory usage to blow up due to the large number of policies. It's a good idea to write a test on the output of the GWT compiler to make sure this doesn't happen.<br/>
