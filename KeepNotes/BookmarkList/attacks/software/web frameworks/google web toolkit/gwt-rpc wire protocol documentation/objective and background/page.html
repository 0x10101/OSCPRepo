Document the GWT-RPC wire protocol as used in GWT 2.5.<br/>
<br/>
Background<br/>
GWT-RPC is a framework that many GWT apps use to communicate between a client application running in a web page and a front-end server written in Java. It's a fairly traditional RPC framework that's loosely based on Java serialization but adapted to work over HTTP. Like Java serialization, it supports serialization of arbitrary Java object graphs, including cycles, provided that they meet certain requirements that make translation between client and server-side Java feasible. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideServerCommunication">official GWT documentation</a>&nbsp;explains how to use it from a developer's perspective.</body></html>
