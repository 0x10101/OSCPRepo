Usually each GWT-RPC service appears at a separate URL. The web page makes RPC calls by sending HTTP(S) POST requests containing a UTF-8 string as the request body. The response is a string in a format similar to but not exactly JSON.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Example</b><br/>
Here's a request taken from the Validation sample app. (You can see these in the "Network" tab of the Chrome Developer Tools.)<br/>
<br/>
7|0|6|http://127.0.0.1:8888/validation/|D031DD0CECD85E06AF1E383A0EC73E6E|com.google.gwt.sample.validation.client.GreetingService|greetServer|com.google.gwt.sample.validation.shared.Person/2669394933|Hello|1|2|3|4|1|5|5|0|6|0|A|<br/>
<br/>
Here's the meaning of each field::<br/>
7 =&gt; The current protocol version.<br/>
0 =&gt; No flags are set.<br/>
6 =&gt; The string table contains six strings, which follow.<br/>
[string table] =&gt; Six strings that the following fields will refer to via a one-based index<br/>
1 =&gt; http://127.0.0.1:8888/validation/ =&gt; The base URL of the GWT app.<br/>
2 =&gt; D031DD0CECD85E06AF1E383A0EC73E6E =&gt; The strong name of the policy file.<br/>
3 =&gt; com.google.gwt.sample.validation.client.GreetingService =&gt; The service interface. (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/source/browse/trunk/samples/validation/src/main/java/com/google/gwt/sample/validation/client/GreetingService.java">Source</a>.)<br/>
4 =&gt; greetServer =&gt; The name of the method to call.<br/>
1 =&gt; The method call has one parameter.<br/>
5 =&gt; com.google.gwt.sample.validation.shared.Person/2669394933 =&gt; This is the declared type of the method's first parameter, which is needed to look up the method.<br/>
5 =&gt; (same) =&gt; This is the runtime type of the first parameter, which happens to be the same as the declared type. This type is checked against the policy file to make sure it's deserializable (the last two flags are true). Here's the entry in the policy file for Person:<br/>
<br/>
com.google.gwt.sample.validation.shared.Person, false, false, true, true, com.google.gwt.sample.validation.shared.Person/2669394933, 2669394933<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/source/browse/trunk/samples/validation/src/main/java/com/google/gwt/sample/validation/shared/Person.java">Person class</a>&nbsp;has four fields which are then serialized in alphabetical order. In this case they all happen to contain primitive Java types. If a field referred to another Java object then its fields would be serialized (recursively).<br/>
0 =&gt; null =&gt; The "address" field , which is null.<br/>
6 =&gt; "Hello" =&gt; The "name" field contains a string.<br/>
0 =&gt; null =&gt; The "otherAddresses" field is null.<br/>
A =&gt; 0 in base64 =&gt; The "ssn" field's value is zero. ("A" is the first base64 character, which decodes to six zero bits.)<br/>
<br/>
Here's the response:<br/>
<br/>
//OK[2,1,["com.google.gwt.safehtml.shared.SafeHtmlString/235635043","Hello, Hello!&lt;br&gt;I am running jetty-6.1.x.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It looks like you are using: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2) AppleWebKit/537.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1229.94 Safari/537.4"],0,7]<br/>
<br/>
Here's the meaning:<br/>
<br/>
"//" The response starts with a JavaScript comment.<br/>
"OK" indicates that the method returned success (rather than an exception).<br/>
<br/>
Next is a JavaScript expression that evaluates to an array, which is written in reverse order so that JavaScript can read values via pop(). Here's the meaning of the values (starting from the end):<br/>
<br/>
7 =&gt; The required serialization version.<br/>
0 =&gt; No flags are set.<br/>
[strings] =&gt; A table with two strings in it. The rest of the response will use one-based indices (in forward order) to refer to strings.<br/>
1 =&gt; "com.google.gwt.safehtml.shared.SafeHtmlString/235635043" =&gt; The result type.<br/>
2 =&gt; "Hello, hello..." =&gt; The value of the "html" field in SafeHtmlString.<br/>
</body></html>
