<title>Java Values</title>
</head><body>Java values are represented similarly in the request and response, except that in a request, they are terminated by "|" and in the response, they are JavaScript expressions separated by commas.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Boolean</b><br/>
"0" is false, any other string is true. The type is serialized as "Z".<br/>
<br/>
<b>Byte</b><br/>
An integer between -128 and 127. Type is "B".<br/>
<br/>
<b>Char</b><br/>
Read as a Java integer, but only the low 16 bits are used. (Cast from int to char.) Type is "C".<br/>
<br/>
<b>Short</b><br/>
Read using Short.parseShort(). Type is "S".<br/>
<br/>
<b>Integer</b><br/>
Read using Integer.parseInt(). Type is "I".<br/>
<br/>
<b>Long</b><br/>
Version 5 represented a long as two doubles. Versions 6 and above represent a long as a base64 value, using '$' and '_' for 62 and 63. Unexpected ascii characters are treated as zero. If the base64 number doesn't fit into a long, the low 64 bits are taken. &nbsp;Type is "J". In the response, the base64 value has single quotes around it.<br/>
<br/>
