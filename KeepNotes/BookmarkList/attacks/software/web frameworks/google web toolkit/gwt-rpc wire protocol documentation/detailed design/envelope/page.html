</b><b>How the client code chooses the URL</b><br/>
Each GWT-RPC service is represented by a client-side stub (a subclass of RemoteServiceProxy). When constructed, the stub calculates the service's default URL by appending a service-specific suffix to the GWT application's base URL. Developers typically set this suffix using the @RemoteServiceRelativePath annotation on the service interface. The GWT application may override the stub's destination URL by calling setServiceEntryPoint() on the stub and providing a different URL.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible for a servlet to two implement two different services by implementing both their Java interfaces, in which case two client stubs might send RPC calls to the same URL.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>How GWT calculates the base URL</b><br/>
A GWT application's base URL comes from a call to GWT.getModuleBaseURL(), which normally returns a URL pointing to the directory containing the GWT application's javascript files. A JavaScript function named computeScriptBase in the GWT bootstrap script finds this directory. The default script tries various strategies (see the code) but normally it searches the HTML page for a &lt;script&gt; tag pointing to the GWT application's bootstrap script, which has a URL ending with ".nocache.js". The computeScriptBase function may be replaced depending on GWT linker options.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>How the frontend server routes requests to a GWT-RPC service</b><br/>
GWT developers must configure their web frontend to accept requests at the appropriate URL for each service. How configuration happens varies, but typically in a Java web app, the developer adds entries to a web.xml file to bind each subclass of RemoteServiceServlet to its expected URL.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>HTTP(S) Requirements</b><ul><li>Must be a POST request. (Handling starts in AbstractRemoteServiceServlet.doPost)</li>
<li>Unless overridden, the Content-type must be "gwt/x-gwt-rpc; charset=utf-8". (Checked in RPCServletUtils.readContentAsGwtRpc.)</li>
<li>The request must have a header named "X-GWT-Permutation". This is a partial guard against XSRF attacks. (Checked in RemoteServiceServlet.processCall.)</li>
<li>The post body must be a non-empty UTF-8 string.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Request format</b><br/>
The post body is considered as a sequence of fields, using the '|' character as the field terminator. Unescaping (if any) depends on the field.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Response format</b><br/>
The response type is: application/json; charset=utf8. However, the response body is not actually JSON. Responses start with either "//OK" to indicate that the call returned successfully or "//EX" for an exception, followed by a JavaScript expression for an array.<br/>
<br/>
The JavaScript exception need not be a literal array; as a workaround for a bug in IE 6 and 7, large arrays (above 32k elements) are actually encoded as a sequence of "concat" calls to create the array.<br/>
