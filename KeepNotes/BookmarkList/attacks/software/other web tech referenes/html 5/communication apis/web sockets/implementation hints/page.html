<title>Implementation Hints</title>
</head><body>In addition to the elements mentioned above, this is the list of area for which caution must be taken during the implementation.<br/>
<ul><li>Access filtering through the "Origin" HTTP request header</li>
<li>Input / output validation</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Authorization</li>
<li>Access token explicit invalidation</li>
<li>Confidentiality and Integrity</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The section below will propose some implementation hints on every area and will be along with an application example showing all the points described.<br/>
<br/>
The complete source code of the example application is available <a href="https://github.com/righettod/poc-websocket">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Access Filtering</b><br/>
During a websocket channel initiation, the browser send the Origin HTTP request header that contain th source domain initiation the request to handshake. Event if this header can be spoofed in a forged HTTP request (not browser based), it cannot be overrided or forced in a browser context. It then represent a good candidate to apply filtering according to an expected value.<br/>
<br/>
An example of attack using this vector and named Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) is described <a href="https://www.christian-schneider.net/CrossSiteWebSocketHijacking.html">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The code below define a configuration that apply filtering based on a "whitelist" of origins. This ensure that only allowed origins can establish a full handshake<br/>
<br/>
<b>Authentication and Input/Output Validation</b><br/>
When using websocket as communication channel, it's important to use an authentication method allowing the user to receive an access Token that is not automatically sent by the browser and then must be expliclty sent by the client code during each exchange.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://jwt.io/introduction/">JSON Web Token</a>&nbsp;is a good candidate because it allow to transport access ticket information in a stateless and not alterable way. Moreover, it define a validity timeframe. You can find additional information about JWT token hardening on this<a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/JSON_Web_Token_Cheat_Sheet_for_Java.md">&nbsp;cheat sheet</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Validation Schema</a>&nbsp;are used to define and validate the expected content in input and ouput messages.<br/>
