<title>AD Shadow Admins</title>
</head><body>Most security professionals are well aware of the importance of protecting privileged accounts in networks and the potential damage an attacker can cause with access to a privileged account.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
So, what are the privileged accounts?<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
There are four main categories of privileged accounts:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li><b>Domain privileged accounts</b>, such as Domain admin users, DHCP admin users</li>
<li><b>Local privileged accounts</b>, such as Local Administrator accounts on endpoints and servers, and “root” on *nix boxes</li>
<li><b>Application/services privileged accounts</b>, such as DB admins or SharePoint admins</li>
<li><b>Business privileged accounts</b>, such as Finance users or the corporate Twitter account</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Discovering Shadows Admins through ACL Analysis</b>&nbsp;<br/>
Group analysis is not sufficient when attempting to discover all privileged accounts in the domain. Instead, searching and analyzing the ACL permissions granted to each account is a more comprehensive method.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Permission analysis of Active Directory will identify all the accounts that have sensitive permissions. In a good scenario, those accounts are meant to be privileged. But what if there are new, unknown accounts with administrative privileges? Or perhaps there are known, non-privileged accounts that, for an unclear reason, now have administrative privileges? These accounts could pose a significant risk, as they may have remained unnoticed and unsecured for months or years. Worse, the existence of these Shadow Admin accounts could indicate that a cyber attack is currently in-progress, as these accounts may have been created or exploited by an attacker who later “enhanced” them with extra permissions needed to execute malicious actions.<br/>
<br/>
Some tools such as <a href="https://github.com/cyberark/ACLight">ACLight</a>&nbsp;can help discover some of these Shadow Admins. </body></html>
