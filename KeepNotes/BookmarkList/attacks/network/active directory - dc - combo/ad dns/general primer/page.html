<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>The Domain Controller can provide DNS functionality for the domain, and is often needed to be the primary DNS in order to use certain functionality due to SPNs. <br/>
<br/>
First, without implementing some router based wizardry, LLMNR and NBNS requests are contained within a single multicast or broadcast domain respectively. This can greatly limit the scope of a spoofing attack with regards to both the affected systems and potential privilege of the impacted sessions. Second, by default, Windows systems use the following priority list while attempting to resolve name resolution requests through network based protocols:<br/>
<br/>
DNS<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;IPv6<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;IPv4<br/>
LLMNR<br/>
NBNS<br/>
<br/>
While LLMNR/NBNS spoofing should be audited, more direct DNS auditing is the next step. </body></html>
