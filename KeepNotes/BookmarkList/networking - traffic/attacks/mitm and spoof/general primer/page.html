<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>Note that some spoofing techniques may not be effective until clients reload their cache. <br/>
Also note that when exiting spoofing, ensure that clients will still have a route for traffic (otherwise there will be a DoS)<br/>
<br/>
Always try to specifically target clients on a network by using MAC or IP address. The louder you are, the more likely you are to be detected. A computer is not necessarily faster than a dedicated routing/switching device.<br/>
<br/>
It will almost always be usefil to log to a pcap or capture traffic another way in order to troubleshoot or examine if attacks were carried out correctly. <br/>
