</head><body><b>Address representation</b><br/>
The 128 bits of an IPv6 address are represented in 8 groups of 16 bits each. Each group is written as four hexadecimal digits (sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hextet">hextets</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-Graziani2012-33">[33]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-Coffeen2014-34">[34]</a>&nbsp;or more formally a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadectet">hexadectets</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-Horley2013-35">[35]</a>&nbsp;and informally a quibble or quad-nibble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-Horley2013-35">[35]</a>) and the groups are separated by colons (:). An example of this representation is <i>2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329</i>. <br/>
For convenience, an IPv6 address may be abbreviated to shorter notations by application of the following rules. <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>One or more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_zero">leading zeros</a>&nbsp;from any groups of hexadecimal digits are removed; this is usually done to either all or none of the leading zeros. For example, the group <i>0042</i>&nbsp;is converted to <i>42</i>.</li>
<li>Consecutive sections of zeros are replaced with a double colon (::). The double colon may only be used once in an address, as multiple use would render the address indeterminate. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments_(identifier)">RFC</a> <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5952">5952</a>&nbsp;recommends that a double colon not be used to denote an omitted single section of zeros.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-rfc5952sec422-36">[36]</a></li>
</ul>
<br/>
An example of application of these rules: <br/>
&nbsp;Initial address: <i>2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329</i>&nbsp;After removing all leading zeros in each group: <i>2001:db8:0:0:0:ff00:42:8329</i>&nbsp;After omitting consecutive sections of zeros: <i>2001:db8::ff00:42:8329</i>&nbsp;<br/>
The loopback address <i>0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001</i>&nbsp;is defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments_(identifier)">RFC</a> <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5156">5156</a>&nbsp;and may be abbreviated to <i>::1</i>&nbsp;by using both rules. <br/>
As an IPv6 address may have more than one representation, the IETF has issued a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#Recommended_representation_as_text">proposed standard for representing them in text</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-rfc5952-37">[37]</a>&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Link-local address</b><br/>
All interfaces of IPv6 hosts require a link-local address. A IPv6 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address">link-local address</a>&nbsp;is derived from the MAC address of the interface and the prefix <i>fe80::/10</i>. The process involves filling the address space with prefix bits left-justified to the most-significant bit, and filling the MAC address in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUI-64">EUI-64</a>&nbsp;format into the least-significant bits. If any bits remain to be filled between the two parts, those are set to zero.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-rfc-editor.org-32">[32]</a>&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Address uniqueness and router solicitation</b><br/>
Because IPv6 does not implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting_(networking)">broadcast</a>, on which the functionality of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol">Address Resolution Protocol</a>&nbsp;(ARP) is based, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol">Neighbor Discovery Protocol</a>&nbsp;(NDP, ND) is used at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer">link layer</a>&nbsp;to map Layer 3 IPv6 addresses to Layer 2 addresses, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">MAC address</a>&nbsp;of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_cards">network cards</a>. The NDP relies on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMPv6">ICMPv6</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast">multicast</a>&nbsp;transmission.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-38">[38]</a>&nbsp;IPv6 hosts verify the uniqueness of their IPv6 addresses in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network">local area network</a>&nbsp;(LAN) by sending a neighbor solicitation message asking for the link layer address of the IPv6 address. If any other host in the LAN is using that address, it responds. In a LAN, MAC addresses are designed to be unique on each network card, which minimizes chances of duplication.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-T._Narten_pp._54-39">[39]</a>&nbsp;<br/>
After having generated a link-local address, the IPv6 host determines if the LAN is connected to any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)">router</a>&nbsp;network card with IPv6 implementation by sending out a ICMPv6 router solicitation message to the all-routers<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-rfc4862sec551-40">[40]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-rfc4861sec637-41">[41]</a>&nbsp;multicast group with its link-local address as source. If there is no answer after a predetermined number of attempts, the host concludes that no routers are connected. If it does get a response from a router, there will be network information inside that is needed to create a globally unique address. There are also two flag bits that tell the host whether it should use DHCP to get further information and addresses: <br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>The Manage bit, that indicates whether or not the host should use DHCP to obtain additional addresses</li>
<li>The Other bit, that indicates whether or not the host should obtain other information through DHCP. The other information consists of one or more prefix information options for the subnets that the host is attached to, a lifetime for the prefix, and two flags:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#cite_note-T._Narten_pp._54-39">[39]</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>On-link: If this flag is set, the host will treat all addresses on the specific subnet as being on-link, and send packets directly to them instead of sending them to a router for the duration of the given lifetime.</li>
<li>Address: This is the flag that tells the host to actually create a global address.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
