<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>A very common misconfiguration within AD results in the ability to conduct WPAD and NBT-NS poisoning. By default, Windows is configured to search for a Web Proxy Auto-Discovery file when using the internet. This is useful in an organization because the device will send out a broadcast asking for the proxy file and receive one. However, it naturally does not authenticate who is sending the proxy file, allowing an attacker to send a spoofed answer which then asks for credentials. <br/>
<br/>
responder -I eth0 --wpad<br/>
<br/>
In Responder, I see the request come through, which Responder then automatically answers the request with a challenge, which results in the victim sending their username and hashed password (in NTLMv2 format).<br/>
<br/>
The hash can be cracked or passed, etc. <br/>
<br/>
This attack is usually used in conjunction with DNS spoofing to point users to our WPAD server. </body></html>
