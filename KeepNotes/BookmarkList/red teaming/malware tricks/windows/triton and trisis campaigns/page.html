The actor used multiple techniques to hide their activities, cover their tracks, and deter forensic examination of their tools and activities.<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;They renamed their files to make them look like legitimate files, for example, KB77846376.exe, named after Microsoft update files.</li>
<li>They routinely used standard tools that would mimic legitimate administrator activities. This included heavy use of RDP and PsExec/WinRM.</li>
<li>When planting webshells on the Outlook Exchange servers, they modified already existing legitimate flogon.js and logoff.aspx files.</li>
<li>They relied on encrypted SSH-based tunnels to transfer tools and for remote command/program execution.</li>
<li>They used multiple staging folders and opted to use directories that were used infrequently by legitimate users or processes.</li>
<li>They routinely deleted dropped attack tools, execution logs, files staged for exfiltration, and other files after they were finished with them.</li>
<li>They renamed their tools' filenames in the staging folder so that it would not be possible to identify the malware's purpose, even after it was deleted from the disk through the residual artifacts (e.g., ShimCache entries or WMI Recently Used Apps).</li>
<li>They used timestomping to modify the $STANDARD_INFORMATION attribute of the attack tools.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br/>
<ul><li>&nbsp;A sample of a Cryptcat-based backdoor used to establish the initial foothold was recovered during the investigation; the sample was compiled and uploaded to a malware testing environment by the actor in 2014.</li>
<li>Cryptcat- and PLINK-based backdoors were scheduled to execute daily starting from April 28, 2014, using ProgramDataUpdater and NetworkAccessProtectionUpdateDB tasks. This date is unrelated to the observed intrusion timeline and may indicate the date the threat actors first created these persistence mechanisms.</li>
<li>NetExec.exe, a custom lateral movement and remote command execution tool, is self-titled "NetExec 2014 by OSA."</li>
<li>SecHack.exe "by OSA," a custom credential harvesting and reconnaissance tool, was compiled on Oct. 23, 2014.</li>
<li>The attackers used a pirated version of Wii.exe, a public file indexing tool that came with a license from 2010 and has not been updated since 2014.</li>
</ul>
