<title>Finding Missing or Stale Entries</title>
</head><body>Two primary methods:<br/>
<br/>
By looking at LLMNR/NBNS requests!<br/>
In theory, a record that falls down to LLMNR/NBNS shouldn’t exist in DNS. Therefore, these records are eligible to be created by an authenticated user. This method is not practical for rare or one time only name requests. However, if you keep seeing the same requests through LLMNR/NBNS, it may be beneficial to add the record to DNS.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stale records<br/>
These are bit more tricky and rely on scavenging to be <b>disabled</b>. The normal record aging process will also set the dNSTombstoned attribute to ‘True’. Records in this state are considered stale, and if enabled, ready for scavenging. If scavenging is not enabled, these records can hang around in DNS for a while. In my test labs without enabled scavenging, I often find stale records that were originally registered by machine accounts. Caution should be taken when working with stale records. Although they are certainly potential targets for attack, they can also be overwritten or deleted by mistake.</body></html>
