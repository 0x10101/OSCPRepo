<title>Bypass DoH Detection With Domain Fronting</title>
</head><body>&nbsp;Bypass DoH detection with Domain Fronting<br/>
Problem is that a technique called Domain Fronting [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_fronting">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_fronting</a>] also exists, which can be used to i.a. bypass Internet censorship, but also in malicious communication:<br/>
<br/>
$ curl -H 'Host: dns.google.com' 'https://google.com/resolve?name=example.com&amp;type=TXT'<br/>
{"Status": 0,"TC": false,"RD": true,"RA": true,"AD": true,"CD": false,"Question":[ {"name": "example.com.","type": 16}],"Answer":[ {"name": "example.com.","type": 16,"TTL": 20794,"data": "\"v=spf1 -all\""}]}<br/>
<br/>
In Wireshark such traffic will look like:<br/>

<br/>
&nbsp;This can look like a normal Internet traffic as someone is querying Google with a web browser. It may look like it's normal but does not have to be if we will focus on the details, how real communication from a web browser looks like. We can count handshakes, size, time between requests, sequences with other hosts like consent.google.com, www.gstatic.com, adservice.google.com etc. Please note that a malicious actor can also do more advanced simulation of a normal user behaviour. This can become a neverending story, as threat actors can use regular user behaviour simulation to transfer even more data as domain fronting can be used probably for all possible Google hosts:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;$ host -t A google.com<br/>
google.com has address 172.217.16.46<br/>
$ host -t A dns.google.com<br/>

Another problem with distinguishing normal traffic from a malicious one is that for example Firefox allows users to use DoH [<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Trusted_Recursive_Resolver">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Trusted_Recursive_Resolver</a>], which is by default communicating with mozilla.cloudflare-dns.com. At this moment there are a few more DoH services [<a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS">https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS</a>] and in the future we should have a lot more available.<br/>
