<title>The Common Approach to DNS Detection</title>
</head><body><b>Few words about current common approach to detection</b><br/>
One of general approaches used in threat hunting is detection of malicious communication based on the DNS traffic. When an attacker is communicating with the C&amp;C using old style methods such as HTTP(S) it is quite easy to discover such communication, if an organisation has anything which is able to detect such attack like DNS firewall (e.g. OpenDNS Family Shield [<a href="https://signup.opendns.com/familyshield/">https://signup.opendns.com/familyshield/</a>]) and/or traffic inspection using SIEM etc, because common detection tools are using blacklists of malicious domains. When security researchers are using honeypots, perform malware analysis etc, or targeted companies report malicious domains, other organisations can collect these artifacts like domains and use it for detection and/or blocking (e.g. DNS blackhole). As it is described in The Pyramid of Pain [<a href="http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html">http://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html</a>], this is one of the simplest mechanisms for threat hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Another common way for malicious communication is to perform communication with C&amp;C only over DNS queries and that way malware can communicate with C&amp;C using for example TXT, AXFR or ANY DNS records, but not only these as it all depends on creativity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Quoting Cisco Talos Intelligence Group [<a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/03/dnsmessenger.html">https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2017/03/dnsmessenger.html</a>]: “Typically this use of DNS is related to the exfiltration of information. Talos recently analyzed an interesting malware sample that made use of DNS TXT record queries and responses to create a bidirectional Command and Control (C2) channel. This allows the attacker to use DNS communications to submit new commands to be run on infected machines and return the results of the command execution to the attacker. This is an extremely uncommon and evasive way of administering a RAT.”, but in fact, this is not extremely uncommon [https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/]. Each idea of using DNS for malicious traffic is a little different, but at general point detection of such is same. If some of your desktop computers in the office is doing TXT DNS queries, isn’t this suspicious? In which real case desktop, not server, is doing TXT query? Such queries are used usually by server services, for example to check SPF [<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786?hl=en">https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786?hl=en</a>], DKIM [<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?hl=en">https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?hl=en</a>] and any other domain verification for example used by Google [<a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/183895?hl=en">https://support.google.com/a/answer/183895?hl=en</a>] etc.<br/>
<br/>
Sample transfer of shellcode, commands or whatever malicious actor wants to transfer from C&amp;C can look like:<br/>
<br/>

Numbers at the beginning of each line are used to keep the correct order as this is round-robin DNS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS] like approach and the order will be random for each answer.<br/>

Using just a DNS query we were able to transfer shellcode. Same way threat actor is not only able to download information, but can also send (leak) data because it is enough space in each DNS query to do that:<br/>
<br/>
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.<br/>
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.<br/>
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.<br/>
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.example.com<br/>
<br/>
To detect this we can measure the entropy of request, its length, frequency, responses and its TTL etc, but this is not the main subject of this article so we will skip it.<br/>
<br/>
Whole approach is in fact related to malicious actors creativity but summing above, usually attackers can be detected by threat hunting which is based on simple inspection of DNS traffic – monitoring internal DNS logs and also if possible communication to external DNS services which should not happen in common organisation environment as all computers usually are using internal DNS servers. If some computers are resolving domains from external DNS services this should definitely trigger an alert and should be inspected why it is occuring. Using these techniques we are able to detect i.a. initial communication to HTTPS C&amp;C server, C&amp;C communication which is fully done only with DNS requests, malware which is using DGA (Domain Generating Algorithm) etc.<br/>
<br/>
Also keep in mind that attackers can communicate with HTTP server using just an IP address, so without domains and DNS queries, but usually they don’t because it is a lot easier to take down a service which is referred directly to a hardcoded IP than to take down a domain which is used for malicious behaviour. Usually domains are hardcoded in the malware or DGA is in use as mentioned before. For direct IP communication we can do detection which will be based on GeoIP (country based), IP reputation, malicious IP lists (same as with domains), ports and protocol inspections etc. Usually this is also used as another layer for threat hunting techniques where DNS based detection is one of them. These are fundamentals of threat hunting, which are described in mentioned above The Pyramid of Pain.</body></html>
