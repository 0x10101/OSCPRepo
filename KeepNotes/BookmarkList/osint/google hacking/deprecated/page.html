<title>Deprecated</title>
</head><body><b>+</b><br/>
Force an exact‐match search on a single word or phrase.<br/>
Example: jobs +apple<br/>
Sidenote. You can do the same thing by using double quotes around your search.<br/>
<br/>
<b>~</b><br/>
Include synonyms. Doesn’t work, because Google now includes synonyms by default. (Hint: Use double quotes to exclude synonyms.)<br/>
Example: ~apple<br/>
<br/>
<b>inpostauthor:</b><br/>
Find blog posts written by a specific author. This only worked in Google Blog search, not regular Google search.<br/>
Example: inpostauthor:”steve jobs”<br/>
Sidenote. Google blog search was discontinued in 2011.<br/>
<br/>
<b>allinpostauthor:</b><br/>
Similar to “inpostauthor,” but removes the need for quotes (if you want to search for a specific author, including surname.)<br/>
Example: allinpostauthor:steve jobs<br/>
<br/>
<b>inposttitle:</b><br/>
Find blog posts with specific words in the title. No longer works, as this operator was unique to the discontinued Google blog search.<br/>
Example: intitle:apple iphone<br/>
<br/>
<b>link:</b><br/>
Find pages linking to a specific domain or URL. Google killed this operator in 2017, but it does still show some results—they likely aren’t particularly accurate though. (Deprecated in 2017)<br/>
Example: link:apple.com<br/>
<br/>
<b>info:</b><br/>
Find information about a specific page, including the most recent cache, similar pages, etc. (Deprecated in 2017). Note: The <b>id:</b>&nbsp;operator can also be used—the results are identical.<br/>
Sidenote. Although the original functionality of this operator is deprecated, it is still useful for finding the canonical, indexed version of a URL. Thanks to @glenngabe for pointing this one one!<br/>
Example: info:apple.com / id:apple.com<br/>
<br/>
<b>daterange:</b><br/>
Find results from a certain date range. Uses the Julian date format, for some reason.<br/>
Example: daterange:11278–13278<br/>
Sidenote. Not officially deprecated, but doesn’t seem to work.<br/>
<br/>
<b>phonebook:</b><br/>
Find someone’s phone number. (Deprecated in 2010)<br/>
Example: phonebook:tim cook<br/>
<br/>
<b>#</b><br/>
Searches #hashtags. Introduced for Google+; now deprecated.<br/>
Example: #apple</body></html>
