<title>Pair With ADIDNS</title>
</head><body><b>Getting Intranet-Zoned </b><br/>
By default, the web client will only authenticate automatically to hosts in the intranet zone, which means that no dots can be present in the hostname. If the relay server already has a suitable DNS record, then this is not an issue. However, if the relay server is “rogue”, an IP address will not cut it. To overcome that, ADIDNS can be abused to add a new DNS record for the relay server, as Kevin Robertson (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://twitter.com/kevin_robertson">@NetSPI</a>) explained in his blog post <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://blog.netspi.com/exploiting-adidns">Exploiting Active Directory-Integrated DNS</a>.<br/>
