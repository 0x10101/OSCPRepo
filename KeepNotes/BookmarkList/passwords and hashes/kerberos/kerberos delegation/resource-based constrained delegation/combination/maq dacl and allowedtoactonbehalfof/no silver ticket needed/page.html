<title>No Silver Ticket Needed</title>
</head><body><b>Empowering Active Directory Objects and Reflective Resource-Based Constrained Delegation </b><br/>
When Microsoft introduced resource-based constrained delegation, it transformed users and computers into strong, independent AD objects, which are able to configure this new “incoming” delegation for themselves. By default, all resources have an Access Control Entry (ACE) that permits them to configure resource-based constrained delegation for themselves. However, if an attacker has credentials for the account, they can forge a silver ticket and gain access to it anyway.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The problem with silver tickets is that, when forged, they do not have a PAC with a valid KDC signature. If the target host is configured to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/openspecification/2009/04/24/understanding-microsoft-kerberos-pac-validation/">validate KDC PAC Signature</a>, the silver ticket will not work. There may also be other security solutions that can detect silver ticket usage.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
However, if we have credentials for a computer account or even just a TGT, we can configure resource-based constrained delegation from that account to itself, and then use S4U2Self and S4U2Proxy to obtain a TGS for an arbitrary user.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The abuse case would work as follows:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>The attacker compromises credentials or a TGT for a computer account (“Service A”).</li>
<li>The attacker configures resource-based constrained delegation from Service A to itself. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Reflective1.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Reflective1.png" /></a></li>
<li>The attacker uses Rubeus to perform a full S4U attack and obtain a TGS for a user with privileged access to Service A. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Reflective2.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Reflective2.png" /></a></li>
<li>The attacker can pass-the-ticket and impersonate the user to access Service A. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Reflective3.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Reflective3.png" /></a></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br/>

&nbsp;<br/>
This reflective resource-based constrained delegation is, in fact, equivalent to S4U2Self when the account has the TrustedToAuthForDelegation flag set (also known as “protocol transition”), as it allows the account to obtain a forwardable TGS for itself on behalf of users. However, if an account is configured for classic constrained delegation with “Kerberos only” (TrustedToAuthForDelegation is not set and msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo is not null), then the classic conditions take precedence over the resource-based conditions, and so S4U2Self responds with a non-forwardable TGS and S4U2Proxy fails.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Note that this technique will only allow obtaining a TGS for a user as long as it is not set as “sensitive for delegation” and is not a member of the Protected Users group, as you can see in the screenshots below.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Solving a Sensitive Problem </b><br/>
Inspecting the above output closely indicates that S4U2Self works for a user marked as sensitive for delegation and a member of the Protected Users group.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Sensitive3.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Sensitive3.png" /></a><br/>
Closer inspection of the ticket shows that it does not have a valid service name, and it is not forwardable:<br/>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Sensitive4.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Sensitive4.png" /></a><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
But this can easily be changed because <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://www.secureauth.com/blog/kerberos-delegation-spns-and-more">the service name is not in the encrypted part of the ticket</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
An attacker can use an ASN.1 editor to modify the SPN on the TGS obtained from S4U2Self, and turn it into a valid one.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Sensitive5.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Sensitive5.png" /></a><br/>
Once that is done, the attacker has a valid TGS. It is not forwardable, but it is fine for authenticating to the service:<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>

&nbsp;<br/>
So, if an attacker has credentials or a TGT for a computer account, they can obtain a TGS to that computer for any user, including sensitive/protected users, with a valid KDC signature in the PAC.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
That means that obtaining a TGT for a computer account is sufficient to compromise the host.<br/>
