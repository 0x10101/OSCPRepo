<title>Abusing Protocol Transition</title>
</head><body><b>When Accounts Collude - TrustedToAuthForDelegation Who? </b><br/>
For years, Active Directory security experts have been telling us that if we must configure Kerberos delegation, constrained delegation is the way to go, and that we should use “Kerberos only” rather than “any authentication protocol” (as known as “protocol transition”). <br/>
<br/>
But perhaps the choice between “Kerberos only” and “Any authentication protocol” does not actually matter.<br/>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation0.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation0.png" /></a><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
We now know that we can abuse resource-based constrained delegation to get a forwardable TGS for arbitrary users. It follows that if we have credentials (or a TGT) for an account with an SPN and for an account with classic constrained delegation but without “protocol transition”, we can combine these two “features” to mimic “protocol transition”.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
This abuse case would work as follows:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>The attacker compromises an account that has an SPN or creates one (“Service A”).</li>
<li>The attacker compromises an account (“Service B”), which is set for classic constrained delegation to a certain service class at Service C with Kerberos only (TrustedToAuthForDelegation is not set on Service B, and msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo on Service B contains a service on Service C, such as “time/Service C”).</li>
<li>The attacker sets resource-based constrained delegation from Service A to Service B (setting msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity on Service B to contain “Service A” using Service B credentials or a TGT for Service B). <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation1.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation1.png" /></a></li>
<li>The attacker uses Service A credentials/TGT to perform a full S4U2 attack and obtains a forwardable TGS for the victim to Service B. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation2.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation2.png" /></a></li>
<li>The attacker uses Service B credentials/TGT to invoke S4U2Proxy with the forwardable TGS from the previous step, and obtains a TGS for the victim to time/Service C. The attacker can modify the service class of the resulting TGS, for example from “time” to “cifs”, because <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://www.secureauth.com/blog/kerberos-delegation-spns-and-more">the service name is not protected</a>. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation3.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation3.png" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation4.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation4.png" /></a></li>
<li>The attacker can pass-the-ticket to gain access to Service C. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation5.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/TrustedToAuthForDelegation5.png" /></a></li>
