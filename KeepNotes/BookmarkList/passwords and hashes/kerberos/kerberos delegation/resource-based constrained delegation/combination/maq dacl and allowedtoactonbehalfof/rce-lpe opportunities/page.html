<title>RCE/LPE Opportunities</title>
</head><body><b>Thinking Outisde the Box: RCE/LPE Opportunities </b><br/>
As <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html#when-the-stars-align-unconstrained-delegation-leads-to-rce">shown above</a>, if an attacker can compromise a host with unconstrained delegation, RCE can be achieved with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://www.slideshare.net/harmj0y/derbycon-the-unintended-risks-of-trusting-active-directory/41">“the printer bug”</a>&nbsp;and S4U2Self. But unconstrained delegation is not a trivial condition, so I attempted to come up with an attack chain that does not require unconstrained delegation.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
As mentioned above, every resource has the rights to configure resource-based constrained delegation for itself, which can be done via LDAP. This primitive opens the door to RCE/LPE opportunities if an attacker is in a position to perform a successful NTLM relay of a computer account authentication to LDAP.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The abuse case would work as follows:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>The attacker compromises an account that has an SPN or creates one (“Service A”).</li>
<li>The attacker triggers a computer account authentication using a primitive such as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://www.slideshare.net/harmj0y/derbycon-the-unintended-risks-of-trusting-active-directory/41">“the printer bug”</a>.</li>
<li>The attacker performs an NTLM relay of the computer account (“Service B”) authentication to LDAP on the domain controller.</li>
<li>The attacker configures resource-based constrained delegation from Service A to Service B.</li>
<li>The attacker uses Rubeus to perform a full S4U attack and obtain a TGS to Service B for a user that has local administrator rights on that host.</li>
<li>The attacker can pass-the-ticket and gain RCE/LPE, depending on the primitive used to trigger the computer account authentication.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The above scenario is straightforward and too good to be true. However, the reality is that NTLM relay is more complicated than it seems.<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
<b>NTLM Relay 101 </b><br/>
NetNTLM is a challenge-response authentication protocol designed by Microsoft for Windows environments. In the NetNTLM protocol, three messages are exchanged:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>The client sends a NEGOTIATE message to request authentication and “advertise capabilities”.</li>
<li>The server sends a CHALLENGE message that contains a random 8-byte nonce.</li>
<li>The client sends an AUTHENTICATE message that contains a response to the challenge. The response is calculated using a cryptographic function with a key derived from the user’s password (the NTLM hash).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The server validates the response to the challenge. If it is valid, authentication is successful. Otherwise, authentication fails.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The protocol is susceptible to the following relay attack:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position waits for an incoming NEGOTIATE message from a victim.</li>
<li>The attacker relays the NEGOTIATE message to the target server.</li>
<li>The target server sends a CHALLENGE message to the attacker.</li>
<li>The attacker relays the CHALLENGE message to the victim.</li>
<li>The victim generates a valid AUTHENTICATE message and sends it to the attacker.</li>
<li>The attacker relays the valid AUTHENTICATE message to the target server.</li>
<li>The target server accepts the AUTHENTICATE message and the attacker is authenticated successfully.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The following diagram illustrates an NTLM relay attack: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Diagrams/NTLM_Relay.png"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Diagrams/NTLM_Relay.png" /></a><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The NetNTLM protocol does not only provide authentication but can also facilitate a session key exchange for encryption (“sealing”) and signing. The client and the server negotiate whether sealing/signing is required through certain flags in the exchanged messages. The exchanged session key is RC4 encrypted using a key derived from the client’s NTLM hash. The client obviously holds the NTLM hash and can decrypt it. However, a domain member server does not hold the NTLM hash of domain users, but only of local users. When a domain user exchanges a session key with a member server, the member server uses the Netlogon RPC protocol to validate the client’s response to the challenge with a domain controller, and if a session key was exchanged then the key to decrypt it is calculated by the domain controller and provided to the member server. This separation of knowledge ensures that the member server does not obtain the NTLM hash of the client, and the domain controller does not obtain the session key.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
If the client and server negotiate a session key for signing, an attacker performing a relay attack can successfully authenticate, but will not be able to obtain the session key to sign subsequent messages, unless the attacker can obtain one of the following:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>The NTLM hash of the victim.</li>
<li>Credentials for the computer account of the target server.</li>
<li>Compromise a domain controller.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
However, if the attacker obtains any of the above, they do not need to perform an NTLM relay attack to compromise the target host or impersonate the victim, and this is the reason signing mitigates NTLM relay attacks.<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
<b>NTLM Relay 102 </b><br/>
The goal is to perform a successful relay, without negotiating signing or encryption, from any protocol to LDAP.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Most of the primitives I am aware of for eliciting a connection from a computer account are initiated by the SMB client or the RPC client, both of which always seem to negotiate signing. If signing was negotiated in the NTLM exchange, the LDAP service on domain controllers ignores all unsigned messages (tested on Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012R2).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The most obvious next move is to reset the flags that negotiate signing during the NTLM relay. However, Microsoft introduced a MIC (Message Integrity Code, I believe) to the NTLM protocol to prevent that. The MIC is sent by the client in the AUTHENTICATE message, and it protects the integrity of all three NTLM messages using HMAC-MD5 with the session key. If a single bit of the NTLM messages had been altered, the MIC would be invalid and authentication would fail.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Not all clients support MIC, such as Windows XP/2003 and prior, and so it is not mandatory. So another thing to try would be omitting the MIC during the NTLM relay. However, there is a flag that indicates whether a MIC is present or not, and that flag is part of the “salt” used when calculating the NetNTLM response to the challenge. Therefore, if the MIC is removed and the corresponding flag is reset, then the NetNTLM response will be invalid and authentication will fail.<br/>

<b>Reflective NTLM Relay is Dead </b><br/>
Traditionally, NTLM relay of computer accounts was performed reflectively, meaning from a certain host back to itself. Until <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2008/ms08-068">MS08-068</a>, it was commonly performed to achieve RCE by relaying from SMB to SMB.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
After it was patched, reflective cross-protocol NTLM relay was still possible, and was most commonly abused to achieve LPE in attacks such as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/01/16/hot-potato/">Hot Potato</a>. Cross-protocol reflective relay was patched in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2016/ms16-075">MS16-075</a>, which killed reflective relays for good (or until James Forshaw brings it back). <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/09/26/rotten-potato-privilege-escalation-from-service-accounts-to-system/">Rotten Potato</a>/<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://ohpe.it/juicy-potato/">Juicy Potato</a>&nbsp;is still alive and kicking, but it is a different flavour of reflective relay as it abuses local authentication, which ignores the challenge-response.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Post <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2016/ms16-075">MS16-075</a>&nbsp;many security researchers stopped hunting for primitives that elicit computer account authentication, because without reflection they were no longer valuable.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Viable NTLM Relay Primitives for RCE/LPE </b><br/>
An RCE/LPE primitive would require one of the following:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li><b>A client that does not negotiate signing, such as the web client on all Windows versions, including WebDAV clients.</b></li>
<li><b>A client that does not support MIC in NTLM messages, such as Windows XP/2003 and prior.</b></li>
<li>An LDAP service that does not ignore unsigned messages or does not verify the MIC on a domain controller that supports resource-based constrained delegation.<b>&nbsp;I don’t believe that this unicorn exists</b>.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
There are different primitives for triggering the computer account to authenticate over HTTP. Some of them were abused in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/01/16/hot-potato/">Hot Potato</a>. I chose to explore those that take an arbitrary UNC path and then trigger a WebDAV client connection.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Note that on Windows servers, the WebDAV client is not installed by default. On Windows Server 2012R2 and prior, the Desktop Experience feature is required, and on Windows Server 2016 or later, the WebDAV Redirector feature is required. However, on desktops, the WebDAV client is installed by default.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
As I mentioned above, it seems that some researchers no longer care for such primitives. However, as Lee Christensen (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://twitter.com/tifkin_">@tifkin_</a>) demonstrated with the combination of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://www.slideshare.net/harmj0y/derbycon-the-unintended-risks-of-trusting-active-directory/41">“the printer bug”</a>&nbsp;and unconstrained delegation, and as I will demonstrate below, these primitives are still exploitable, and I encourage everyone to keep hunting for them (and tell me all about it when you find them).<br/>
