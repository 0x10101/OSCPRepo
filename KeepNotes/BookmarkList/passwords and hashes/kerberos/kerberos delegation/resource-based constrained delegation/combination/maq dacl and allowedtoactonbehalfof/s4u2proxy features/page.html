<title>S4U2Proxy Features</title>
</head><body>As I was testing my Rubeus modification in preparation for submitting a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus/pull/7">pull request</a>, I reset the TrustedToAuthForDelegation UserAccountControl flag on Service A and expected to see an error message when performing S4U2Self. However, S4U2Self worked, as well as S4U2Proxy, and the resulting TGS provided me with access to Service B.<br/>

&nbsp;<br/>
The ticket I obtained from S4U2Self was not forwardable, and still, S4U2Proxy accepted it and responded with a TGS for the user to Service B.<br/>

<b>A Misunderstood Feature #1 </b><br/>
After a couple more hours of testing, debugging, and reading <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246071.aspx">MS-SFU</a>, I realised that I had misunderstood S4U2Self. It seems S4U2Self works whether the TrustedToAuthForDelegation UserAccountControl flag is set or not. However, if it is not set, the resulting TGS is not FORWARDABLE, as per <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff634450.aspx">section 3.2.5.1.2 of MS-SFU</a>:<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
“If the <i>TrustedToAuthenticationForDelegation</i>&nbsp;parameter on the Service 1 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246073.aspx#gt_8492780e-99e2-47ba-8553-aedb8de9f9c0">principal</a>&nbsp;is set to:<br/>

<li><b>FALSE</b>&nbsp;and <i>ServicesAllowedToSendForwardedTicketsTo</i>&nbsp;is nonempty: the KDC MUST NOT set the FORWARDABLE ticket flag ([RFC4120] section 2.6) in the S4U2self service ticket.”</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>A Misunderstood Feature #2 </b><br/>
So, S4U2Proxy still shouldn’t have worked with a non-forwardable ticket, right?<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
When I attempted invoking S4U2Proxy with a non-forwardable TGS with classic (“outgoing”) constrained delegation, it failed. But with resource-based constrained delegation (“incoming”) it consistently worked. I thought it must be a bug, and so on 26/10/2018, I reported it to Microsoft Response Center (MSRC).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
As I was impatiently waiting for a response, I read <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246071.aspx">MS-SFU</a>&nbsp;again and found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff634460.aspx">section 3.2.5.2</a>:<br/>
