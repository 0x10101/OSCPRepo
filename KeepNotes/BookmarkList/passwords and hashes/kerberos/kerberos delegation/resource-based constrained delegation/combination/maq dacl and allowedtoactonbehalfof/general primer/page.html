</head><body>MAQ DACL and allowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity<br/>
<br/>
The <b>tl;dr</b>&nbsp;is that Elad’s new research gives us a generalized DACL-based computer takeover primitive (among other things, however I’m focusing just on this example for now). This means that if we have an ACE entry allowing us the ability to somehow modify a specific field for a computer object in Active Directory (specifically msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity, so rights would include GenericAll, GenericWrite, WriteOwner, etc.) we can abuse this access and a modified S4U Kerberos ticket request process to compromise the computer itself. &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
The <b>tl;dr </b>of the <b>tl;dr</b>&nbsp;is that if we can modify a computer object in Active Directory, we can compromise the computer itself in modern domains.<br/>
<br/>
There’s one caveat: the domain the computer resides in has to have at least one 2012+ domain controller in order to support the resource-based constrained delegation abuse. If this isn’t the case, and the domain only has domain controllers with Server 2008 (an 11 year old operating system) there are probably other issues you can target for abuse : )<br/>
<br/>
This post is lengthy, and I am conscious that many of you do not have the time or attention span to read it, so I will try to convey the important points first:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;<a href="https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html#serendipity">Resource-based constrained delegation does not require a forwardable TGS when invoking S4U2Proxy</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html#a-misunderstood-feature-1">S4U2Self works on any account that has an SPN</a>, regardless of the state of the TrustedToAuthForDelegation attribute. If TrustedToAuthForDelegation is set, then the TGS that S4U2Self produces is forwardable, unless the principal is sensitive for delegation or a member of the Protected Users group.</li>
<li>The above points mean that <a href="https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html#generic-dacl-abuse">if an attacker can control a computer object in Active Directory, then it may be possible to abuse it to compromise the host</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html#a-forwardable-result">S4U2Proxy always produces a forwardable TGS, even if the provided additional TGS in the request was not forwardable</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html#when-accounts-collude---trustedtoauthfordelegation-who">The above point means that if an attacker compromises any account with an SPN as well as an account with classic constrained delegation, then it does not matter whether the TrustedToAuthForDelegation attribute is set</a>.</li>
<li>By default, any domain user can abuse the <a href="nbk:///76173172-2e38-403f-b211-6d4f022963ee">MachineAccountQuota</a>&nbsp;to create a computer account and set an SPN for it, which makes it even more trivial to abuse resource-based constrained delegation to mimic protocol transition (obtain a forwardable TGS for arbitrary users to a compromised service).</li>
<li><a href="https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html#solving-a-sensitive-problem">S4U2Self allows generating a valid TGS for arbitrary users, including those marked as sensitive for delegation or members of the Protected Users group</a>. The resulting TGS has a PAC with a valid KDC signature. All that’s required is the computer account credentials or a TGT.</li>
<li><a href="https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html#when-the-stars-align-unconstrained-delegation-leads-to-rce">The above point in conjunction with unconstrained delegation and “the printer bug” can lead to remote code execution (RCE)</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html#unconstrained-domain-persistence">Resource-based constrained delegation on the krbtgt account allows producing TGTs for arbitrary users, and can be abused as a persistence technique</a>.</li>
<li>Configuring resource-based constrained delegation through NTLM relay from HTTP to LDAP may facilitate <a href="https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html#case-study-1-mssql-rcelpe">remote code execution (RCE) or local privilege escalation (LPE) on MSSQL servers</a>, and <a href="https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html#case-study-2-windows-1020162019-lpe">local privilege escalation (LPE) on Windows 10/2016/2019</a>.</li>
<li>Computer accounts just got a lot more interesting. Start hunting for more primitives to trigger attack chains!</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br/>
In order to configure constrained delegation, one has to have the SeEnableDelegation Privilege, which is sensitive and typically only granted to Domain Admins. In order to give users/resources more independence, Resource-based Constrained Delegation was introduced in Windows Server 2012. Resource-based constrained delegation allows resources to configure which accounts are trusted to delegate to them.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
This flavour of constrained delegation is very similar to the classic constrained delegation but works in <b>the opposite direction</b>. Classic constrained delegation from account A to account B is configured on account A in the msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo attribute, and defines an “outgoing” trust from A to B, while resource-based constrained delegation is configured on account B in the msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity attribute, and defines an “incoming” trust from A to B.<br/>
<br/>
An important observation is that every resource can configure resource-based constrained delegation for itself. In my mind, it does make sense to allow resources to decide for themselves who do they trust.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Will and I came up with the following abuse case to compromise a specific host:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>An attacker compromises an account that has the TrustedToAuthForDelegation flag set (“Service A”).</li>
<li>The attacker additionally compromises an account with the rights to configure resource-based constrained delegation for the computer account of the target host (“Service B”).</li>
<li>The attacker configures resource-based constrained delegation from Service A to Service B.</li>
<li>The attacker invokes S4U2Self and S4U2Proxy as Service A to obtain a TGS for a privileged user to Service B to compromise the target host.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br/>
It is a nice trick, but compromising an account with the TrustedToAuthForDelegation flag set is not trivial. If only my crusade to defeat TrustedToAuthForDelegation had been more fruitful, it would come in handy for this abuse case. &nbsp;</body></html>
