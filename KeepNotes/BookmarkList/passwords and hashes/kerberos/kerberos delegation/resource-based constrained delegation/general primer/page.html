Windows Server 2012 <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831747(v=ws.11)#resource-based-constrained-delegation-across-domains-and-forest">implemented a new type of delegation</a>, <b>resource-based constrained delegation</b>, in response to some of the downsides of traditional constrained delegation. Specifically, resource-based constrained delegation allows for delegation settings to be configured on the target service/resource instead of on the “front-end” account (i.e. the account configured with <b>msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo</b>&nbsp;settings in the traditional constrained delegation example.) <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/ps-remoting-second-hop?view=powershell-6#information-on-resource-based-kerberos-constrained-delegation">This Microsoft document</a>&nbsp;contains some excellent resources on this topic:<br/>

Resource-based constrained delegation is implemented with a security descriptor on the target resource, instead of a list of SPNs on the “frontend” account that the frontend account is allowed to delegate to. This security descriptor is stored as a series of binary bytes in the <b><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh554126.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396">msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity</a></b>&nbsp;property on a target computer object. This field is supported on Windows 8.1+ and Windows Server 2012+ computer objects assuming there is at least one Server 2012 domain controller in the environment. Of note, domain admin/equivalent rights are not needed to modify this field, as opposed to previous forms of delegation. The only right needed is the ability to edit this property on a computer object in Active Directory, so rights like GenericAll/GenericWrite/WriteDacl/etc. against the target computer object all apply here.<br/>

In order to execute this, a user needs to be able to execute the S4U2Self process (the TRUSTED_TO_AUTH_FOR_DELEGATION UserAccountControl setting, bit 16777216). The user executes the S4U2Self process to a special forwardable service ticket <i>to itself</i>&nbsp;on behalf of a particular user. The user then executes the rest of the S4U2Proxy process as they would with traditional constrained delegation (with one small exception, described below). The DC checks if the user is allowed to delegate to the target system based on the <b>msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity</b>&nbsp;security descriptor, allowing the process to continue if the requesting user is in the DACL.<br/>
