<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>tl;dr: At the heart of this matter is the delegation of privileges – allowing one user to pretend to be another in Active Directory. This delegation (currently) comes in two flavors: unconstrained and constrained delegation.<br/>
<br/>
The field of interest is <b>msds-allowedtodelegateto</b>, but there’s also a modification to the account’s userAccountControl property. Essentially, if a computer/user object has a userAccountControl value containing <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa772300(v=vs.85).aspx">TRUSTED_TO_AUTH_FOR_DELEGATION</a>&nbsp;then anyone who compromises that account can impersonate <b>any</b>&nbsp;user to the SPNs set in <b>msds-allowedtodelegateto</b>. Ben <a href="https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/trust-years-to-earn-seconds-to-break/">mentions SeEnableDelegationPrivilege</a>&nbsp;being required to actually modify these parameters &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
It starts with the TRUSTED_TO_AUTHENTICATE_FOR_DELEGATION (T2A4D) User-Account-Control flag. It applies to user accounts, and the repercussions it can have when configured within a Windows environment.<br/>
<br/>
The User-Account-Control attribute, not to be confused with the Windows UAC mechanism, sets particular attributes on Active Directory accounts, such as if the account is disabled, locked out, or if the user's password never expires. The T24AD flag, when applied to a user account, is used for a Kerberos mechanism known as 'Protocol Transition'. It was created to solve a specific problem in which users authenticate to a service that doesn't support Kerberos authentication, but the service wishes to delegate their tokens to secondary services, e.g. MSSQL or CIFS, to access resources whilst impersonating those users.<br/>
<br/>
To allow this process to occur, the Kerberos protocol extension 'Service For User To Self' (S4U2Self) was implemented by Microsoft. This extension allows a service to request a token for another user, by supplying their user principal name, but without supplying a password. When the user account has the T24AD flag, these tokens can be requested with the 'forwardable' attribute which allows the service to authenticate with these tokens to other services.<br/>
<br/>
Now unconstrained delegation is bad, <a href="nbk:///7c2ddfa4-ab4e-436f-9abc-520444c2bc68">mmkay</a>? So Microsoft ensured that these tokens could only be used for specific services which are configured on the user account via the 'Service For User To Proxy' (S4U2Proxy) extension. This setting is controlled by the <b>msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo</b>&nbsp;attribute on the user account. It contains a list of <b>Service Principal Names</b>&nbsp;that point to which Kerberos services the user can forward these tokens to (the same way normal Kerberos Constrained Delegation is performed). <br/>
<br/>
For example, you wish for your web service to access a file share for users so you would specify that the service account has an msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo value of "cifs/fs.contoso.com". This in effect allows the web service account to authenticate to the CIFS/SMB file share as any user in the domain, so requires a lot of trust in that application.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<ul><li>1. The user authenticates to the web service using a non-Kerberos compatible authentication mechanism</li>
<li>2. The web service requests a ticket from the Key Distribution Center (KDC) for the 'user' account without supplying a password, as the svc_web account</li>
<li>3. The KDC checks the svc_web userAccountControl value for the TRUSTED_TO_AUTHENTICATE_FOR_DELEGATION flag, and that the target user is not blocked for delegation. If OK it returns a forwadable ticket for the 'user' account (S4U2Self)</li>
<li>4. The service then passes this ticket back to the KDC and requests a service ticket for the cifs/fs.contoso.com service</li>
<li>5. The KDC checks the msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo field on the svc_web account. If the service is listed it will return a service ticket for the file share (S4U2Proxy)</li>
<li>6. The web service can now authenticate to the file share as the 'user' account using the supplied ticket</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br/>

Microsoft released ‘constrained’ delegation with Windows 2003. This included a set of Kerberos protocol extensions called S4U2Self and S4U2Proxy. I covered this process in depth in the <a href="http://www.harmj0y.net/blog/activedirectory/s4u2pwnage/">S4U2Pwnage</a>&nbsp;post and covered some new Rubeus weaponizations against constrained delegation in the <b>s4u</b>&nbsp;section of the <a href="http://www.harmj0y.net/blog/redteaming/from-kekeo-to-rubeus/">From Kekeo to Rubeus</a>&nbsp;post. &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Operationally, without getting into the implementation details of S4U2Self/S4U2Proxy, any accounts (user or computer) that have service principal names (SPNs) set in their <b>msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo</b>&nbsp;property can pretend to be any user in the domain (they can “delegate”) to those specific SPNs. Additionally, <a href="https://twitter.com/agsolino">Alberto Solino</a>&nbsp;discovered that <a href="https://www.coresecurity.com/blog/kerberos-delegation-spns-and-more">service name (sname) is not protected in the KRB-CRED file</a>, only the server name is. This means that any service name can be substituted and we’re not restricted <i>just</i>&nbsp;to the specified SPN!<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
So while delegation has been “constrained” to specific targets, this is still dangerous. If you could modify the <b>msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo </b>contents for an account you control to include, say, <b>ldap/DC.domain.com</b>, then that account could DCSync the current domain! Luckily for us, Microsoft anticipated this attack. You need a right called SeEnableDelegationPrivilege <i>on a domain controller</i>&nbsp;to modify any of the previously described delegation settings. By default just elevated accounts like Domain/Enterprise admins will have this right on DCs, which is actually one of the main motivations for our next type of delegation. I talked more about this right in the “<a href="http://www.harmj0y.net/blog/activedirectory/the-most-dangerous-user-right-you-probably-have-never-heard-of/">The Most Dangerous User Right You (Probably) Have Never Heard Of</a>” post.<br/>
