This is another overview regarding Kerberos and can be utilized alongside other resources in Passwords and Hashes &gt; Kerberos<br/>
<br/>
If you are not up to speed with abusing Kerberos delegation, you should first read the post <a href="http://www.harmj0y.net/blog/activedirectory/s4u2pwnage/">S4U2Pwnage</a>&nbsp;by Will Schroeder (@<a href="https://twitter.com/harmj0y">harmj</a>0y) and Lee Christensen (@<a href="https://twitter.com/tifkin_">tifkin</a>_). In that post, they explained it better than I ever could, but I will try to capture it very concisely as well.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
First, a simplified overview of Kerberos:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>When users log in, they encrypt a piece of information (a timestamp) with an encryption key derived from their password, to prove to the authentication server that they know the password. This step is called “preauthentication”. Preauth is enabled by default.</li>
<li>In Active Directory environments, the authentication server is a domain controller.</li>
<li>Upon successful preauthentication, the authentication server provides the user with a ticket-granting-ticket (TGT), which is valid for a limited time.</li>
<li>When a user wishes to authenticate to a certain service, the user presents the TGT to the authentication server. If the TGT is valid, the user receives a ticket-granting service (TGS), also known as a “service ticket”, from the authentication server.</li>
<li>The user can then present the TGS to the service they want to access, and the service can authenticate the user and make authorisation decisions based on the data contained in the TGS.</li>
</ul>

A few important notes about Kerberos tickets:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>Every ticket has a clear-text part and an encrypted part.</li>
<li>The clear-text part of the ticket contains the Service Principal Name (SPN) of the service for which the ticket is intended.</li>
<li>The encryption key used for the encrypted part of the ticket is derived from the password of the account of the target service.</li>
<li>TGTs are encrypted for the built-in account “krbtgt”.</li>
<li>The SPN on TGTs is krbtgt/domain name.</li>
</ul>

Often, there is a requirement for a service to impersonate the user to access another service. To facilitate that, the following delegation features were introduced to the Kerberos protocol:</body></html>
