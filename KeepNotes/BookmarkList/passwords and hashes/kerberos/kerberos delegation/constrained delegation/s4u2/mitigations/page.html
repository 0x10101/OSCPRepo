Microsoft has a great protection already built into Active Directory that can help mitigate delegation abuse. If an account has “<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/poshchap/2015/05/01/security-focus-analysing-account-is-sensitive-and-cannot-be-delegated-for-privileged-accounts/"><i>Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated</i></a>” enabled, then “<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa772300(v=vs.85).aspx"><i>the security context of the user will not be delegated to a service even if the service account is set as trusted for Kerberos delegation</i></a>“. You can easily check if an account has this set by again examining the userAccountControl attribute, checking for the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa772300(v=vs.85).aspx">NOT_DELEGATED</a> value. PowerView allows you to easily search for accounts with this value set or not set (<b>Get-DomainUser -AllowDelegation/-DisallowDelegation</b>) and you can use the <b>ConvertFrom-UACValue</b> function to examine the values set for a particular account, as shown in previous examples.<br/>

This configuration isn't going to be present in all environments, but it is worthwhile checking your exposure with a quick LDAP search to identify if any accounts are affected, and take the following steps to mitigate your exposure if required:<br/>
<br/>
Query your domain for T2A4D accounts, using the LDAP Filter (userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=16777216). Ensure that these don't have access to any privileged services or machines in their msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo field. Additionally check who has full control, or write access, to the msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo field and limit this access appropriately.<br/>
Deprecate any T2A4D services where possible, or use Kerberos Constrained Delegation without protocol transition.<br/>
Limit the exposure of services configured with this setting and reduce their susceptibility to attacks.<br/>
Give the service account a strong password, or take advantage of Managed Group Service Accounts in Win2k12 domains.<br/>
Ensure all sensitive user accounts are prevented from being delegated using the 'Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated' attribute or by using the 'Protected Users' groups (Win2k12R2+).<br/>
Verify the user accounts in the User Rights Assignment property "Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation" in the Default Domain Controller Group Policy Object, or any GPOs that apply to your domain controllers.</body></html>
