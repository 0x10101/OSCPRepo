<title>Abusing S4U and Protocol Transition</title>
</head><body>We can think of a few ways that the S4U extensions can come into play on a pentest.<br/>
<br/>
The first is to enumerate all computers and users with a non-null msds-allowedtodelegateto field set. This can be done easily with PowerView’s -TrustedToAuth flag for Get-DomainUser/Get-DomainComputer:<br/>
<br/>
Now, remember that a machine or user account with a SPN set under msds-allowedtodelegateto can pretend to be any user they want to the target service SPN. So if you’re able to compromise one of these accounts, you can spoof elevated access to the target SPN. For the HOST SPN this allows complete remote takeover. For a MSSQLSvc SPN this would allow DBA rights. A CIFS SPN would allow complete remote file access. A HTTP SPN it would likely allow for the takeover of the remote webservice, and LDAP <a href="https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi/status/806643377278173185">allows for DCSync</a>&nbsp;; ) HTTP/SQL service accounts, even if they aren’t elevated admin on the target, can also possibly be abused with <a href="https://foxglovesecurity.com/2016/09/26/rotten-potato-privilege-escalation-from-service-accounts-to-system/">Rotten Potato</a>&nbsp;to elevate rights to SYSTEM (though I haven’t tested this personally).<br/>
<br/>
Luckily for us, <a href="https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi/status/806643377278173185">Benjamin recently released</a>&nbsp;a modification to Kekeo to help facilitate these types of lateral spread attacks if we know the plaintext password of the specific accounts. Lee and I envision four different specific scenarios involving S4U that you may want to abuse. We have tested two of the scenarios in a lab reliably. asktgt.exe accepts a /key:NTLM argument as well as a password. This allows us to execute scenarios 3 and 4 below using account hashes instead of plaintexts!<br/>
<br/>
Scenario 1 : User Account Configured For Constrained Delegation + A Known Plaintext<br/>
Scenario 2 : Agent on a Computer Configured For Constrained Delegation<br/>
Scenario 3 : User Account Configured For Constrained Delegation + A Known NTLM Hash<br/>
Scenario 4 : Computer Account Configured For Constrained Delegation + A Known NTLM Hash &nbsp;</body></html>
