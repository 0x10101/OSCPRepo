<title>S4U2Self</title>
</head><body>So you have a web service account that needs to impersonate users to only a specific backend service, but you don’t want to allow unconstrained delegation to run wild. Microsoft’s solution to how to architect this is through the service-for-user (S4U) set of Kerberos extensions. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc995228.aspx">There’s</a>&nbsp;extensive <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj553400(v=ws.11).aspx">documentation</a>&nbsp;on this topic; Lee and I were partial to the Microsoft’s “<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246072.aspx">Kerberos Protocol Extensions: Service for User and Constrained Delegation Protocol</a>” ([MS-SFU]).<br/>
<br/>
The first extension that implements constrained delegation is the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246078.aspx">S4U2self</a>&nbsp;extension, which allows a service to request a special forwardable service ticket to itself on behalf of a particular user. This is meant for use in cases where a user authenticates to a service in a way not using Kerberos, i.e. in our web service case. During the first KRB_TGS_REQ to the KDC, the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246073.aspx#gt_4c6cd79b-120d-4ee1-ab24-d1b000e0b3ca">forwardable</a>&nbsp;flag it set, which requests that the TGS returned be marked as forwardable and thus able to be used with the S4U2proxy extension. In unconstrained delegation, a TGT is used to identify the user, but in this case the S4U extension uses the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246089.aspx">PA-FOR-USER</a>&nbsp;structure as a new type in the “padata”/pre-authentication data field.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the S4U2self process can be executed for <b>any</b>&nbsp;user, and that target user’s <b>password is not required</b>. Also, the S4U2self process is only allowed if the requesting user has the TRUSTED_TO_AUTH_FOR_DELEGATION field set in their userAccountControl.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Lee and I first thought that this may be a way to Kerberoast any user we wanted, but unfortunately for us attackers this isn’t the case. The PAC is signed for the source (not the target) user, in this case the requesting service account, so universal Kerberoasting is out of the picture. But we now have a special service ticket that’s forwardable to the target service configured for constrained delegation in this case.</body></html>
