<title>S4U2Proxy</title>
</head><body>The second extension is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246079.aspx">S4U2proxy</a>, which allows the caller, the service account in our case, to use this forwardable ticket to request a service ticket to any SPN specified in msds-allowedtodelegateto, impersonating the user specified in the S4U2self step. The KDC checks if the requested service is listed in the msds-allowedtodelegateto field of the requesting user, and issues the ticket if this check passes. In this way the delegation is ‘constrained’ to specific target services.<br/>
<br/>
<b>A Misunderstood Feature #2 </b><br/>
So, S4U2Proxy still shouldn’t have worked with a non-forwardable ticket, right?<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
When I attempted invoking S4U2Proxy with a non-forwardable TGS with classic (“outgoing”) constrained delegation, it failed. But with resource-based constrained delegation (“incoming”) it consistently worked. I thought it must be a bug, and so on 26/10/2018, I reported it to Microsoft Response Center (MSRC).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
As I was impatiently waiting for a response, I read <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246071.aspx">MS-SFU</a>&nbsp;again and found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff634460.aspx">section 3.2.5.2</a>:<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
“If the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246073.aspx#gt_b4041466-ae24-4fd4-83e4-5dbc4f32aaab">service ticket</a>&nbsp;in the <b>additional-tickets</b>&nbsp;field is not set to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246073.aspx#gt_4c6cd79b-120d-4ee1-ab24-d1b000e0b3ca">forwardable&lt;20&gt;</a>&nbsp;and the PA-PAC-OPTIONS [167] (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc233855.aspx">[MS-KILE]</a>&nbsp;section <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh553950.aspx">2.2.10</a>) padata type has the resource-based <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc246073.aspx#gt_b7f30547-6d3a-4224-9441-434174c2dec1">constrained delegation</a>&nbsp;bit:<br/>

</ul>
&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
It seems like a design flaw, also known in Microsoft parlance as a “feature”. S4U2Proxy for resource-based constrained delegation works when provided with a non-forwardable TGS by design!<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Note that as per the above documentation, even though the TGS doesn’t have to be forwardable for resource-based constrained delegation, if the user is set as “sensitive for delegation”, S4U2Proxy will fail, which is expected.<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
<b>A Forwardable Result </b><br/>
When I inspected the resulting TGS in the S4U2Proxy response, it had the FORWARDABLE flag set. I provided S4U2Proxy with a non-forwardable TGS as “evidence” and got a forwardable TGS.<img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20190315093814im_/http://shenaniganslabs.io/images/TrustedToAuthForDelegationWho/Forwardable.png" /><br/>

Is this a bug or a feature?<br/>

&nbsp;<br/>
It seems like it is another great feature: <b>every TGS produced by S4U2Proxy is always forwardable.</b></body></html>
