<title>ASEPRoasting With Rubeus</title>
</head><body>To exploit this, we’ll use a tool called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190312142307/https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus">Rubeus.</a>&nbsp;Rubeus is a massive toolset for abusing Kerberos, but for conducting ASREPRoasting, we care about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190312142307/https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus#asreproast">this section</a>. To use Rubeus, you first need to install <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190312142307/https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532606&clcid=0x409">Visual Studio.</a>&nbsp;Once installed, download Rubeus and open the Rubeus.sln file with Visual studio. &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By default, it will install in the Rubeus\bin\Debug\ file. cd into that directory, then run it:<br/>
.\Rubeus.exe asreproast &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
If no users have <i>‘Do not require Kerberos preauthentication’</i>&nbsp;checked, then there won’t be any users to roast. But if there is… &nbsp;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We then can get the hash for the user and crack it.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Keep in mind that the examples were done on a computer already joined to the domain, so if you were doing this from a computer not on the domain, you would have to pass in the domain controller, domain name, OUs, etc.<br/>
