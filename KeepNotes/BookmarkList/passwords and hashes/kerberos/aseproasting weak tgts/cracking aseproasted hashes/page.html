<title>Cracking ASEPRoasted Hashes</title>
</head><body>This may be easier as tools are updated to include this specific ASN.1 type!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

We now have a nice set hash representations of RC4-HMAC AS-REPs, each of which are encrypted with a user’s password. We should now be able to crack these offline à la Kerberosting (<b>krb5tgs</b>&nbsp;format in John the Ripper), but remember that despite using the same algorithm and approach as the existing TGS-REP format, the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190223142423/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4757#section-3">message type here is 8 instead of 2</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
This unfortunately means that existing plugins won’t work, but luckily for us, all we have to do is change <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190223142423/https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/b06be900f357c8d594e1c4e38d54eb0db06a4e24/src/krb5_tgs_fmt_plug.c#L270">this line</a> to an 8 instead of a 2, remove some of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190223142423/https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/blob/b06be900f357c8d594e1c4e38d54eb0db06a4e24/src/krb5_tgs_fmt_plug.c#L332-L334">specific TGS ASN.1 speedups</a>, and change the format naming. I have a included a tweaked version of this <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190223142423/https://github.com/adaptivethreat/ASREPRoast/blob/master/krb5_asrep_fmt_plug.c">krb5_asrep_fmt_plug.c plugin with the ASREPRoast project</a>. Simply drop it into the source folder for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190223142423/https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper/tree/bleeding-jumbo/src">Magnumripper</a>, run the normal build instructions, and you’d good to go for cracking the output of ASREPRoast.ps1:<br/>

I believe that it should be simple to modify Hashcat’s existing TGS-REP format as well in a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190223142423/https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/OpenCL/m13100_a0.cl#L659">similar way</a>, but I haven’t attempted it yet. Also, because this is the same algorithm as the krb5tgs/Kerberoasting format, just with a tweak in key material, performance should be similar to the existing modules. &nbsp;</body></html>
