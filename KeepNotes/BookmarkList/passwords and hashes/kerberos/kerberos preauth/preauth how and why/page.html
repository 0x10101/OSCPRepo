<title>Preauth How and Why</title>
</head><body>Under normal operations in a Windows Kerberos environment, when you initiate a TGT request for a given user (Kerberos AS-REQ, message type 10) you have to supply a timestamp encrypted with that user’s key/password. This structure is PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP and is embedded in PA-DATA (preauthorization data) of the AS-REQ – both of these structure are described in detail <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190223142423/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4120#page-60">on page 60 of RFC4120</a>&nbsp;and were introduced in Kerberos Version 5. The KDC then decrypts the timestamp to verify if the subject making the AS-REQ really is that user, and then returns the AS-REP and continues with normal authentication procedures.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;the KDC <i>does</i> increase the <b>badpwdcount</b>&nbsp;attribute for any incorrect PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP attempts, so we can’t use this as a method to online brute-force account passwords :(<br/>
<br/>
The reason for Kerberos preauthentication is to prevent offline password guessing. While the AS-REP <i>ticket</i>&nbsp;itself is encrypted with the <i>service</i>&nbsp;key (in this case the krbtgt hash) the AS-REP “encrypted part” is signed with the <i>client</i>&nbsp;key, i.e. the key of the user we send an AS-REQ for. If preauthentication isn’t enabled, an attacker can send an AS-REQ for any user that doesn’t have preauth required and receive a bit of encrypted material back that can be cracked offline to reveal the target user’s password. &nbsp;<br/>

In modern Windows environments, all user accounts require Kerberos preauthentication, but interestingly enough, by default Windows attempts the AS-REQ/AS-REP exchange without preauthentication first, falling back to supplying the encrypted timestamp on the second submission.<br/>
