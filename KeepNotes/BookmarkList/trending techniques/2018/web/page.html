<br/>
1. Breaking Parser Logic - <a href="https://twitter.com/orange_8361?lang=en">Orange Tsai</a>&nbsp;has taken an attack surface many mistakenly thought was hardened beyond hope, and smashed it to pieces. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28xWcRegncw">superb presentation</a>&nbsp;shows how subtle flaws in path validation can be twisted with consistently severe results. &nbsp;<br/>
2. Practical Web Cache Poisoning - This research by er <a href="https://twitter.com/albinowax">James Kettle</a>&nbsp;shows techniques to <a href="https://portswigger.net/blog/practical-web-cache-poisoning">poison web caches with malicious content</a>&nbsp;using obscure HTTP headers. &nbsp;<br/>
3. Beyond XSS - Continuing the theme of legacy web technologies getting a second wind as exploit vectors, <a href="https://twitter.com/ldionmarcil">Louis Dion-Marcil</a>&nbsp;discovered that numerous popular reverse proxies sometimes let hackers abuse <a href="https://gosecure.net/2018/04/03/beyond-xss-edge-side-include-injection/">Edge Side Includes</a>&nbsp;to give their XSS superpowers including SSRF. &nbsp; <br/>
4. Prototype pollution attacks in NodeJS applications &nbsp;- It's always great to see a language-specific vulnerability that doesn't affect PHP, and this research <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUsiFV3dsK8">presented</a>&nbsp;by <a href="https://twitter.com/_holyvier_">Olivier Arteau</a>&nbsp;at NorthSec is no exception. It details a novel technique to get <a href="https://github.com/HoLyVieR/prototype-pollution-nsec18">RCE on NodeJS applications</a>&nbsp;by using __proto__ based attacks that have previously only been applied to client-side applications. &nbsp;<br/>
5. Attacking 'Modern' Web Technologies &nbsp;- In which <a href="https://twitter.com/fransrosen">Frans Rosen</a>&nbsp;shares some quality research showing that deprecated or not, you can abuse HTML5 AppCache for some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJCCOnF25JU&t=0s&list=PLpr-xdpM8wG9yT6HD6YeCbf6wymhAAqRb&index=15">wonderful exploits</a>. &nbsp; <br/>
6. It's A PHP Unserialization Vulnerability Jim But Not As We Know It &nbsp;- It's been known in some circles for a while that harmless sounding file operations like file_exists() could be abused using PHP's phar:// stream wrapper to trigger deserialisation and obtain RCE, but <a href="https://twitter.com/_s_n_t">Sam Thomas</a>' <a href="https://github.com/s-n-t/presentations/blob/master/us-18-Thomas-It's-A-PHP-Unserialization-Vulnerability-Jim-But-Not-As-We-Know-It.pdf">whitepaper</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GePBmsNJw6Y">presentation</a>&nbsp;finally dragged it out into the light for good with a robust investigation of practical concerns and numerous exploitation case studies including our friend WordPress. &nbsp;<br/>
7. Exploiting XXE with local DTD files &nbsp;- In a blog post described by Nicolas as 'how to innovate in a well-known field', <a href="https://twitter.com/_mohemiv">Arseniy Sharoglazov</a>&nbsp;shares a <a href="https://mohemiv.com/all/exploiting-xxe-with-local-dtd-files/">creative technique</a>&nbsp;to avoid the firewall problem by using a local file instead. &nbsp; <br/>
8. Prepare(): Introducing novel Exploitation Techniques in WordPress &nbsp;- WordPress is such a complex beast that exploiting it is increasingly becoming a stand-alone discipline. In this presentation, <a href="https://blog.ripstech.com/tags/robin-peraglie/">Robin Peraglie</a> shares <a href="https://youtu.be/h17hOpaJ0XE?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG9yT6HD6YeCbf6wymhAAqRb">in-depth research</a>&nbsp;of WordPress' misuse of double prepared statements, with a nice touch on PHP's infamous unserialize. &nbsp;<br/>
9. Data Exfiltration via Formula Injection &nbsp;- <br/>
In this <a href="https://www.notsosecure.com/data-exfiltration-formula-injection/">blog post</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/9r4shar4j4y">Ajay</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://twitter.com/iambalaji7">Balaji</a> explore a number of techniques for exfiltrating data from spreadsheets in Google Sheets and LibreOffice. It might be less shiny than higher-ranked items, but this is practical, easily applicable research that will be invaluable for anyone looking to quickly prove the impact of a formula injection vulnerability.<br/>
If you're wondering what malicious spreadsheets have to do with web security, check out <a href="https://www.contextis.com/en/blog/comma-separated-vulnerabilities">Comma Separated Vulnerabilities</a>. It's also worth mentioning that 2018 also brought us the first documented <a href="https://www.bishopfox.com/blog/2018/06/server-side-spreadsheet-injections/">server-side formula injection</a>.<br/>
10. XS-Searching Google's bug tracker to find out vulnerable source code &nbsp;- This blog post by <a href="https://medium.com/@luanherrera">Luan Herrera</a>&nbsp;looks like a straightforward vulnerability write up, right up until he innovatively uses a browser <a href="https://medium.com/@luanherrera/xs-searching-googles-bug-tracker-to-find-out-vulnerable-source-code-50d8135b7549">cache timing technique</a>&nbsp;to eliminate network latency from a notoriously unreliable technique, making it surprisingly practical. I think we can expect to see more XS-Search bugs in the future. &nbsp;</body></html>
