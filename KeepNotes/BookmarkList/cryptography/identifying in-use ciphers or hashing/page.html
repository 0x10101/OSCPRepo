<title>Identifying In-Use Ciphers or Hashing</title>
</head><body>While on a pentest, how can you identify the cipher in use? <br/>
<br/>
<b>Is it a hash?</b><br/>
Tools like hash-identifier will evaluate a hash by length and format and give recommendations<br/>
<br/>
<b>Is it even encrypted?</b><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Look at data size:</b><br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Not evenly divisible by 8? Increased likelyhood to be a stream cipher<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Always divisible by 16: Increased likelyhood for block cipher 128-bit block (AES)<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Sometimes divisibly by 16, always by 8: 64-bit block size (DES/3DES)<br/>
Look for documentation from vendor, call engineering support, etc<br/>
