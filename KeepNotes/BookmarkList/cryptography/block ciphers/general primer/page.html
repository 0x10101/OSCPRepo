In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>, a <b>block cipher</b>&nbsp;is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm">deterministic algorithm</a>&nbsp;operating on fixed-length groups of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bits</a>, called a <i>block</i>, with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_key">symmetric key</a>. Block ciphers operate as important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_primitive">elementary components</a>&nbsp;in the design of many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol">cryptographic protocols</a>, and are widely used to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">encryption</a>&nbsp;of bulk data. <br/>
<br/>
The modern design of block ciphers is based on the concept of an iterated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_cipher">product cipher</a>. In his seminal 1949 publication, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_Theory_of_Secrecy_Systems">Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems</a></i>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>&nbsp;analyzed product ciphers and suggested them as a means of effectively improving security by combining simple operations such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">substitutions</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher">permutations</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#cite_note-shannon-1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Iterated product ciphers carry out encryption in multiple rounds, each of which uses a different subkey derived from the original key. One widespread implementation of such ciphers, named a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feistel_network">Feistel network</a>&nbsp;after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Feistel">Horst Feistel</a>, is notably implemented in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard">DES</a>&nbsp;cipher.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#cite_note-tilborg-2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Many other realizations of block ciphers, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>, are classified as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution%E2%80%93permutation_network">substitutionâ€“permutation networks</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#cite_note-FOOTNOTEvan_TilborgJajodia20111268-3">[3]</a>&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
The publication of the DES cipher by the United States National Bureau of Standards (subsequently the U.S. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>, NIST) in 1977 was fundamental in the public understanding of modern block cipher design. It also influenced the academic development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis">cryptanalytic attacks</a>. Both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_cryptanalysis">differential</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_cryptanalysis">linear cryptanalysis</a>&nbsp;arose out of studies on the DES design. As of 2016 there is a palette of attack techniques against which a block cipher must be secure, in addition to being robust against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack">brute-force attacks</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Even a secure block cipher is suitable only for the encryption of a single block under a fixed key. A multitude of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation">modes of operation</a>&nbsp;have been designed to allow their repeated use in a secure way, commonly to achieve the security goals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality">confidentiality</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication">authenticity</a>. However, block ciphers may also feature as building blocks in other cryptographic protocols, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hash_function">universal hash functions</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-random_number_generator">pseudo-random number generators</a>. <br/>
