</head><body>Practical evaluation<br/>
Block ciphers may be evaluated according to multiple criteria in practice. Common factors include:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMenezesvan_OorschotVanstone1996227-32">[32]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#cite_note-AESr2report-33">[33]</a>&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>Key parameters, such as its key size and block size, both of which provide an upper bound on the security of the cipher.</li>
<li>The <i>estimated security level</i>, which is based on the confidence gained in the block cipher design after it has largely withstood major efforts in cryptanalysis over time, the design's mathematical soundness, and the existence of practical or certificational<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#cite_note-34">[34]</a>&nbsp;attacks.</li>
<li>The cipher's <i>complexity</i>&nbsp;and its suitability for implementation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_hardware">hardware</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software">software</a>. Hardware implementations may measure the complexity in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_count">gate count</a>&nbsp;or energy consumption, which are important parameters for resource-constrained devices.</li>
<li>The cipher's <i>performance</i>&nbsp;in terms of processing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput">throughput</a>&nbsp;on various platforms, including its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory">memory</a>&nbsp;requirements.</li>
<li>The <i>cost</i>&nbsp;of the cipher, which refers to licensing requirements that may apply due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property_right">intellectual property rights</a>.</li>
<li>The <i>flexibility</i>&nbsp;of the cipher, which includes its ability to support multiple key sizes and block lengths.</li>
</ul>
