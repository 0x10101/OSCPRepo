Some modes such as the CBC mode only operate on complete plaintext blocks. Simply extending the last block of a message with zero-bits is insufficient since it does not allow a receiver to easily distinguish messages that differ only in the amount of padding bits. More importantly, such a simple solution gives rise to very efficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack">padding oracle attacks</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#cite_note-padding-attack-25">[25]</a>&nbsp;A suitable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_(cryptography)">padding scheme</a>&nbsp;is therefore needed to extend the last plaintext block to the cipher's block size. While many popular schemes described in standards and in the literature have been shown to be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#cite_note-padding-attack-25">[25]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#cite_note-oz-pad-26">[26]</a>&nbsp;a solution which adds a one-bit and then extends the last block with zero-bits, standardized as "padding method 2" in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9797-1">ISO/IEC 9797-1</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#cite_note-iso-iec_9797-1-27">[27]</a>&nbsp;has been proven secure against these attacks.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#cite_note-oz-pad-26">[26]</a>&nbsp;<br/>
