<br/>
Rule 0: Never use the same key twice<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Need to have a way to deal with key change/key selection/etc<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Must change the key BEFORE the IV repeats<br/>
IV is not a secret<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Longer means more IVs before rotation<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;IV selection is important. Sequential? dealing with reboots? rolling over? multiple ciphers with same key, but no IV coordination?<br/>

<br/>
For a stream cipher to be secure, its keystream must have a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_function">period</a>&nbsp;and it must be impossible to <i>recover the cipher's key</i>&nbsp;or internal state from the keystream. Cryptographers also demand that the keystream be free of even subtle biases that would let attackers <i>distinguish</i>&nbsp;a stream from random noise, and free of detectable relationships between keystreams that correspond to <i>related keys</i>&nbsp;or related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce">cryptographic nonces</a>. That should be true for all keys (there should be no <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_key">weak keys</a></i>), even if the attacker can <i>know</i>&nbsp;or <i>choose</i>&nbsp;some <i>plaintext</i>&nbsp;or <i>ciphertext</i>. <br/>
<br/>
As with other attacks in cryptography, stream cipher attacks can be <i>certificational</i>&nbsp;so they are not necessarily practical ways to break the cipher but indicate that the cipher might have other weaknesses. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Securely using a secure synchronous stream cipher requires that one never reuse the same keystream twice.</b>&nbsp;That generally means a different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce">nonce</a>&nbsp;or key must be supplied to each invocation of the cipher. Application designers must also recognize that most stream ciphers provide <b>not <i>authenticity</i>&nbsp;but <i>privacy</i></b>: encrypted messages may still have been modified in transit. <br/>
<br/>
Short periods for stream ciphers have been a practical concern. For example, 64-bit block ciphers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard">DES</a>&nbsp;can be used to generate a keystream in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_feedback">output feedback</a>&nbsp;(OFB) mode. However, when not using full feedback, the resulting stream has a period of around 232 blocks on average; for many applications, the period is far too low. For example, if encryption is being performed at a rate of 8 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte">megabytes</a>&nbsp;per second, a stream of period 232 blocks will repeat after about a half an hour.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Accuracy_dispute#Disputed_statement"><i>dubious</i></a><i>&nbsp; â€“ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Stream_cipher#Dubious">discuss</a></i>] <br/>
<br/>
Some applications using the stream cipher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4">RC4</a>&nbsp;are attackable because of weaknesses in RC4's key setup routine; new applications should either avoid RC4 or make sure all keys are unique and ideally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Related_key">unrelated</a>&nbsp;(such as generated by a well-seeded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator">CSPRNG</a>&nbsp;or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash function</a>) and that the first bytes of the keystream are discarded. </body></html>
