<title>WinDbg and CDB</title>
</head><body><span style="font-size: 10pt">WinDbg/CDB<br/>
<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: Roboto-Regular">WinDbg is a Microsoft Windows kernel and user-mode debugging utility. The Microsoft Console Debugger (CDB) cdb.exe is also user-mode debugger. Both utilities are included in Windows software development kits and can be used as standalone tools. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/index">[7]</a> They are commonly used in software development and reverse engineering and may not be found on typical Windows systems. Both WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe binaries are signed by Microsoft.<br/>
</span></div><br/>
<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: Roboto-Regular">An adversary can use WinDbg.exe and cdb.exe to proxy execution of arbitrary code to bypass application whitelist policies that do not account for execution of those utilities. <a href="http://www.exploit-monday.com/2016/08/windbg-cdb-shellcode-runner.html">[8]</a><br/>
</span></div><br/>
<div style="text-align: left"><span style="font-family: Roboto-Regular">It is likely possible to use other debuggers for similar purposes, such as the kernel-mode debugger kd.exe, which is also signed by Microsoft.<br/>
