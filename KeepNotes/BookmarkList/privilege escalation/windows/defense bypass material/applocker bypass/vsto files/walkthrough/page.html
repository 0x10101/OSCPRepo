<b>Please, Tell Me More About This “VSTO” Application</b><br/>
VSTO (.vsto) is actually a manifest file that is bundled with a collection of files for VSTO application deployment and installation. &nbsp;Upon compilation in Visual Studio (Visual C#), the VSTO release bundle is created with the following files:<br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">&lt;appname&gt;.vsto – VSTO Manifest</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">&lt;appname&gt;.dll – VSTO Assembly</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">&lt;appname.dll&gt;.manifest – VSTO Assembly Manfest</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">&lt;appname&gt;.pdb – VSTO Debugging Information</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">Microsoft.Office.Tools.Common.vX.X.Utilities.dll – &nbsp;Visual Studies Helper Assembly</li>
</ul>
<br/>
With other options selected within Visual Studio, it is possible to bundle other (pre)requisite files for application compatibility. &nbsp;When “optionally” deployed with ClickOnce, the VSTO bundle is ‘published’ within a ClickOnce Directory structure that includes a ClickOnce VSTO deployment manifest file.<br/>
<br/>
<b>VSTO Walkthrough<br/>
</b>This POC walkthrough will consist of VSTO application payload creation, compilation, installation, and execution. &nbsp;Let’s begin…<br/>
<br/>
First, we create a project in Visual Studio. &nbsp;For VSTO, we must &nbsp;(and we do) have the VSTO prereqs installed. &nbsp;To create a project, we select Visual C#, Office/SharePoint, and the VSTO add-in for an Office application. &nbsp;For this exercise, we choose Word and call the project vstoevil…<br/>
<br/>
Visual Studio sets up our baseline template. &nbsp;We edit the ThisAddIn_Startup function with our payload. &nbsp;In this case, we will invoke notepad.exe…<br/>

<br/>
Open the project properties menu. &nbsp;Under Application, verify or edit the target framework. &nbsp;Changing the target framework will likely result in the refreshing the Visual Studio project, but it should take us back to this screen afterward. &nbsp;For this exercise, we’ll stick with the current framework…<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Select properties/options as necessary. &nbsp;Under Signing, this is where an important decision has to be made with regard to signing the ClickOnce manifest. &nbsp;A legitimate cert has its own merits (but other requirements) for installation (such as in a social engineering situation). &nbsp;A self-signed cert is easy to create but will likely prevent installation/execution of the payload (such as in a social engineering situation). &nbsp;In our example, we are going to self-sign without a password. &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
However, we will not be installing with a ClickOnce deployment package in this walkthrough. &nbsp;In our lab, ClickOnce will likely fail due to policy and the ClickOnce deployment wizard certificate check. &nbsp;Instead, we are going to move the compiled bundle (as outlined above) to the lab machine and directly execute the VSTO manifest installer…<br/>

<br/>
Under Publish, this is where you can set options for managing the deployment package such as web publishing, version increments, update checks, prerequisite software, file dependencies, etc. &nbsp;For now, we will remove pre-reqs and set a publishing path but keep everything else at a default level…<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 4.png" /><br/>
<br/>
Let’s go ahead and “Publish” the project. &nbsp;This will compile the code as well as prepare the ClickOnce Application. &nbsp;Since our attention is only on the compiled code, we verify the contents within the “Release” directory…<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 5.png" /><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We move our VSTO bundle to the target machine that is configured with Default AppLocker Rules. &nbsp;Our logged-in user does not possess any administrator rights or privileges. &nbsp;For validation of rules, let’s attempt to load vstoevil.dll directly. &nbsp;You may recall <a href="https://bohops.com/2018/01/23/loading-alternate-data-stream-ads-dll-cpl-binaries-to-bypass-applocker/">control.exe</a>&nbsp;from another blog entry… <br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 6.png" /><br/>
<br/>
As expected, our DLL assembly was prevented from running due to AppLocker rules. &nbsp;Let’s invoke the vsto installer (vstoinstaller.exe) by executing vstoevil.vsto. &nbsp;We are prompted with a sanity check…<br/>
<img src="image 7.png" /><br/>
<br/>
(Un)Fortunately, our unprivileged user account can perform a “no-admin” installation of this package. &nbsp;After installation and verification, we launch Word to see our new add-in and payload results…<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 8.png" /><br/>
<br/>
Success! Notepad.exe is executed when the VSTO add-in program is loaded in Word.<br/>
