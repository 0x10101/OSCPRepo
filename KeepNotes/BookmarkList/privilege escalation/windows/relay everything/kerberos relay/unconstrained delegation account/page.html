<title>Unconstrained Delegation Account</title>
</head><body><b>Unconstrained delegation account </b><br/>
The first thing we need is an account that has unconstrained delegation privileges. This means an account that has the TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION UserAccountControl flag set. This can be on either a user account or a computer account. Any user in AD can query those accounts, using for example <a href="https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/184f9822b195c52dd50c379ed3117993">PowerView</a>:<br/>
$Computers = Get-DomainComputer -Unconstrained<br/>
$Users = Get-DomainUser -ldapfilter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)" &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Or the ActiveDirectory Powershell module:<br/>
$computers = get-adcomputer -ldapfilter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)"<br/>
$user = get-aduser -ldapfilter "(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)"<br/>
<br/>
Or they can be extracted using one of my own tools, <a href="https://github.com/dirkjanm/ldapdomaindump">ldapdomaindump</a>, which will report users/computers that have this privilege with the TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION flag:<br/>
grep TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION domain_computers.grep<br/>
grep TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION domain_users.grep<br/>
<br/>
Once we compromised an account, which means we have obtained the account password or Kerberos keys, we can decrypt Kerberos service tickets used by users authenticating to the service associated with the compromised account. Previous ways to abuse unconstrained delegation involve dumping the cached tickets from LSASS using for example Mimikatz or <a href="https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus/">Rubeus</a>, but this requires executing code on a compromised host. In this blog we’ll avoid doing that, and instead do the whole thing over the network from a host we fully control without having to worry about endpoint detection or crashing production servers by dumping processes (though this doesn’t apply to Rubeus since it uses native APIs).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
For user accounts, passwords can be obtained the typical way, by Kerberoasting, cracking NTLMv1/NTLMv2 authentication, simply guessing weak passwords or dumping them from memory on compromised hosts. Computer accounts are harder to obtain since they do by default have very strong randomly generated passwords and their password/keys only reside on the host the account belongs to (or on the DC). When we have Administrator rights on the associated host, it becomes relatively easy since the computer account password is stored in the registry and thus can be obtained via the network with <a href="https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/tree/master/examples">secretsdump.py</a>, or by dumping the secrets with mimikatz lsadump::secrets. Both also support dumping secrets from offline registry hives.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
To calculate the Kerberos keys from plaintext passwords, we also need to specify the salt. If you’re familiar with Kerberos, you’ll know that there are different encryption algorithms used. The weakest cipher supported by modern AD installs uses RC4, with a key based on the NTLM hash of the user (not including any salt). The AES-128 and AES-256 ciphers that Windows will pick by default however do include a salt, which we will need to include in the key calculation. The salt to calculate these keys <a href="https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Powermad/blob/master/Powermad.ps1#L4187">is as follows</a>:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>For user accounts, it is the uppercase Kerberos realm name + case sensitive username</li>
<li>For computer accounts, it is the uppercase realm name + the word host + full lowercase hostname</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The Kerberos realm name is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain (so not the NETBIOS name!), the full hostname is also the FQDN of the host, not just the machine name, and does not include an $. The username used as salt for user accounts is the case-sensitive SAMAccountName (so if the user is called awEsOmEusER1 then awesomeuser1 will not generate the correct key).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
For computer accounts, I’ve added functionality to secretsdump.py which will automatically dump the machine Kerberos keys if you run it against a host (you will need at least impacket 0.9.18 or run the latest development version <a href="https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket">from git</a>). If it can’t figure out the correct salt for some reason you can specify this yourself to krbrelayx.py with the --krbpass or --krbhexpass (for hex encoded binary computer account passwords) and --krbsalt parameters. As a sidenote, this took me way longer than expected to implement since computer accounts passwords are random binary in UTF-16-LE, but Kerberos uses UTF-8 input for key deriviation. The UTF-16 bytes are however not valid unicode, which makes Python not too happy when you try to convert this to UTF-8. It took me a while to figure out that Microsoft implementations actually implicitly replace all invalid unicode characters when performing the conversion to UTF-8 for Kerberos keys. After telling python to do the same the keys started matching with those on my DC ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.<br/>
