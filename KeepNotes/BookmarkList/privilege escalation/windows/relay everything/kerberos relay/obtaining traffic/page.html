<title>Obtaining Traffic</title>
</head><body>Obtaining traffic <br/>
There are a multitude of ways now to obtain traffic from users to the attackers host. Any technique on the internet discussing NTLM authentication gathering techniques will work for getting users to authenticate to your rogue SMB or HTTP server. Some options are:<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>Phishing sites with a UNC path or redirect</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://github.com/lgandx/Responder">responder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh">Inveigh</a>&nbsp;or metasploit to reply to LLMNR/NBNS requests</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://github.com/fox-it/mitm6">mitm6</a>&nbsp;for DNS hijacking</li>
<li>Placing files with an icon linking to a UNC path on a popular file share within the network</li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Two very effective to obtain Domain Admin (equivalent) privileges via unconstrained delegation at the point of writing of this blog is to abuse bugs that require only regular user credentials to make a high value target connect to you. At this point, two important example are known:<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li><b>SpoolService bug</b>: There is a Remote Procedure Call part of the MS-RPRN protocol which causes remote computers to authenticate to arbitrary hosts via SMB. This was discovered by Lee Christensen aka <a href="https://twitter.com/tifkin_">@tifkin_</a>&nbsp;and called the “printer bug”. Harmj0y recently did a writeup on abusing this bug as well to perform unconstrained delegation attacks over forest trusts <a href="http://www.harmj0y.net/blog/redteaming/not-a-security-boundary-breaking-forest-trusts/">in his blog</a>. The MS-RPRN protocol was also implemented in <a href="https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket">impacket</a>&nbsp;by <a href="https://twitter.com/agsolino/">@agsolino</a>, and of course I couldn’t resist writing a small utility for it as part of the krbrelayx toolkit, called printerbug.py, which triggers the backconnect.</li>
<li><b>PrivExchange</b>: The Exchange Web Services (EWS) SOAP API exposes a method that subscribes to push notifications. This method can be called by any user with a mailbox and will make Exchange connect to any host we specify via HTTP. When requested, Exchange will (unless it is patched with the latest CU) authenticate with the computer account of the system Exchange is running on. This computer account has high privileges in the domain by default. I wrote about this in my <a href="https://dirkjanm.io/abusing-exchange-one-api-call-away-from-domain-admin/">previous blog</a>&nbsp;and the privexchange.py tool is available <a href="https://github.com/dirkjanm/PrivExchange">here</a>. Apart from NTLM relaying this authentication to LDAP, we can also use unconstrained delegation to obtain Exchange’s TGT and use that to perform an ACL based privilege escalation.</li>
</ul>
