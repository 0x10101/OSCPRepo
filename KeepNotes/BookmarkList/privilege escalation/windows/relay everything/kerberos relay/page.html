</head><body>[krbrelayx](https://github.com/dirkjanm/krbrelayx) | Kerberos unconstrained delegation abuse toolkit<br/>
<br/>
Because tooling for unconstrained delegation abuse is quite scarce, I wrote a new toolkit, krbrelayx, which can abuse unconstrained delegation and get Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs) from users connecting to your host. In this blog we will dive deeper into unconstrained delegation abuse and into some more advanced attacks that are possible with the krbrelayx toolkit.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Relaying Kerberos??? </b><br/>
Before we start off, let’s clear up a possible confusion: <b>no, you cannot actually relay Kerberos authentication in the way you can relay NTLM authentication</b>. The reason the tool I’m releasing is called krbrelayx is because it works in a way similar to impackets <a href="https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py">ntlmrelayx</a>&nbsp;(and shares quite some parts of the code). Kerberos tickets are partially encrypted with a key based on the password of the service a user is authenticating to, so sending this on to a different service is pointless as they won’t be able to decrypt the ticket (and thus we can’t authenticate). <br/>
<br/>
<b>So what does this tool actually do? </b>When Windows authenticates to service- or computeraccounts that have unconstrained delegation enabled, some interesting stuff happens (which I’ll explained later on) and those accounts end up with a usable TGT. If we (as an attacker) are the ones in control of this account, this TGT can then be used to authenticate to other services. Krbrelayx performs this in a similar way to when you are relaying with ntlmrelayx (with automatic dumping of passwords, obtaining DA privileges, or performing ACL based attacks), hence the similar naming. If you first want to read about what unconstrained delegation is on a high level, I recommend <a href="https://adsecurity.org/?p=1667">Sean Metcalf’s blog</a>&nbsp;about it.<br/>

<b>Attack requirements </b><br/>
To perform this unconstrained delegation attack, we already need to have a couple of requirements:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>Control over an account with unconstrained delegation privileges</li>
<li>Permissions to modify the servicePrincipalName attribute of that account <i>(optional)</i></li>
<li>Permissions to add/modify DNS records <i>(optional)</i></li>
<li>A way to connect victim users/computers to us</li>
</ul>
