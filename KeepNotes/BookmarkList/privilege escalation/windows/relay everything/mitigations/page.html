<title>Mitigations</title>
</head><body>Relay attacks depend on various components to work. Several defenses <a href="https://www.fox-it.com/en/insights/blogs/blog/inside-windows-network/">against NTLM relaying</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://blog.fox-it.com/2018/04/26/escalating-privileges-with-acls-in-active-directory/">against relaying to LDAP specifically</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The most important mitigations applicable to this attack are:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>Remove the unnecessary high privileges that Exchange has on the Domain object (see below for some links on this).</li>
<li>Enable LDAP signing and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034879/how-to-add-the-ldapenforcechannelbinding-registry-entry">enable LDAP channel binding</a>&nbsp;to prevent relaying to LDAP and LDAPS respectively</li>
<li>Block Exchange servers from making connections to workstations on arbitrary ports.</li>
<li>Enable <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd767318%28v=vs.90%29.aspx">Extended Protection for Authentication</a>&nbsp;on the Exchange endpoints in IIS (but not the Exchange Back End ones, this will break Exchange). This will verify the channel binding parameters in the NTLM authentication, which ties NTLM authentication to a TLS connection and prevent relaying to Exchange web services.</li>
<li>Remove the registry key which makes relaying back to the Exchange server possible, as discussed in Microsofts <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8581">mitigation for CVE-2018-8518</a>.</li>
<li>Enforce SMB signing on Exchange servers (and preferable all other servers and workstations in the domain) to prevent cross-protocol relay attacks to SMB.</li>
</ul>
