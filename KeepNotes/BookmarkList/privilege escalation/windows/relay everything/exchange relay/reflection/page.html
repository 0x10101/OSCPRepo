<br/>
This is a SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) bug that allowed anyone on an Exchange server impersonate anyone else on that Exchange server. A user can specify a desired URL for PushSubscription and Exchange will use CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials for the connection. <br/>
<br/>
Within Exchange Web Services, CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials runs as NT Authority\System. The exchange server will send NTLM hashes to the attacker's server. In this instance (default at the time), the following registry key was set to 1:<br/>
<br/>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\DisableLoopbackCheck<br/>
<br/>
This allows the NTLM hashes to be used for HTTP authentication. Since it's running as NT Authority\SYSTEM, an attacker can get a 'privileged' session with TokenSerializationRight and then use a SOAP header to impersonate any desired user. Here's an example header than impersonates the Administrator user with the specified SID:<br/>

<br/>
This attack requires credentials to access OWA (Outlook Web Access) and some <a href="https://github.com/thezdi/PoC/tree/master/CVE-2018-8581">python scripts</a>, and the SID of the person we want to impersonate. <br/>
<br/>
1. Log into OWA<br/>
2. Create a new folder, right click and select permissions<br/>
3. Add the email of the person to impersonate (eg. victim@contoso.local)<br/>
4. Open dev console (F12) and choose network tab. Click on permissions again.<br/>
5. Review the response on the first "service.svc?action=GetFolder" request<br/>
<br/>
Body-&gt;ResponseMessages-&gt;Items-&gt;0-&gt;Folders-&gt;0-&gt;PermissionSet-&gt;Permissions-&gt;N-&gt;UserId-&gt;SID &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
In the above path, N is 2, but check them all to find the correct one. PrimarySmtpAddress should be the desired victime. If it does not contain PermissionSet item, look at another service.svc request. <br/>
<br/>
6. Use the SID in serverHTTP_relayNTLM.py for impersonation of the victim user. Choose any TCP port that is unlikely to be blocked on the attacker controlled machine and will allow an outgoing connection to the Exchange Server. <br/>
7. Update static variables in the script and run it.<br/>
8. Last step is to trigger a Push Notification. We can wait or we can perform an action like create and send a new email, or delete the new folder. If successfuly, we should receive an inbound connection from the Exchange server to our serverHTTP_relayNTLM.py.<br/>
<br/>
The attack will create a rule on the victim inbox that will forward all inbound emails to the attacker. <br/>
<br/>
Similar results should be able to be achieved through other EWS APIs like AddDelegate or assigning edit permissions to the target folder. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8581">Microsoft's mitigation </a>is that the registry key should be deleted (enabling a loopback check). If desired, an attacker could always add this registry key to enable the functionality. <br/>
