<title>Exchange</title>
</head><body>Exchange is often (but not always) running with more privileges than necessary. Due to this misconfiguration, it can be possible to relay these credentials for elevated access. This is possible due to Exchange's ability to authenticate to an arbutrary URL over HTTP via the PushSubscription feature.<br/>
<br/>
This was assigned a <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0686">CVE-2019-0686</a>&nbsp;and may have been patched/fixed, but still worth checking.<br/>
(To address this vulnerability, Microsoft has changed the notifications contract established between EWS clients and Exchange Servers to not allow authenticated notifications to be streamed by the server. Instead, these notifications will be streamed using anonymous authentication mechanisms.)<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to use these credentials to impersonate other users. This is called a reflection attack. <br/>
It is possible to use these credentials to grant elevated rights. This is a privilege escalation.</body></html>
