<title>NTLM and Kerberos</title>
</head><body>This is another example of insecure Active Directory default abuse, and not any kind of new exploit.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Attack TL;DR </b><br/>
If an attacker is on the local network, either physically (via a drop device) or via an infected workstation, it is possible to perform a DNS takeover using <a href="https://github.com/fox-it/mitm6">mitm6</a>, provided IPv6 is not already in use in the network. When this attack is performed, it is also possible to make computer accounts and users authenticate to us over HTTP by spoofing the WPAD location and requesting authentication to use our rogue proxy. This attack is described in detail in <a href="https://blog.fox-it.com/2018/01/11/mitm6-compromising-ipv4-networks-via-ipv6/">my blog post on this subject</a>&nbsp;from last year.<br/>

We can relay this NTLM authentication to LDAP (unless mitigations are applied) with ntlmrelayx and authenticate as the victim computer account. Computer accounts can modify some of their own properties via LDAP, which includes the msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity attribute. This attribute controls which users can authenticate to the computer <b>as almost any account in AD</b>&nbsp;via impersonation using Kerberos. This concept is called Resource-Based constrained delegation, and is described in detail by <a href="https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html">Elad Shamir</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://posts.specterops.io/another-word-on-delegation-10bdbe3cd94a">harmj0y</a>. Because of this, when we relay the computer account, we can modify the account in Active Directory and give ourselves permission to impersonate users on that computer. We can then connect to the computer with a high-privilege user and execute code, dump hashes, etc. The beauty of this attack is that it works by default and does not require any AD credentials to perform.<br/>

<b>Tools </b><br/>
The updated version of ntlmrelayx is available in a branch on <a href="https://github.com/dirkjanm/impacket/tree/rbdelrelay">my fork of impacket</a>. Iâ€™ll update the post once this branch gets merged into the main repository.<br/>
