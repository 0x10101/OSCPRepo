<title>Other Abuse Avenues</title>
</head><body><b>Other abuse avenues </b><br/>
This blog highlights the use of mitm6 and WPAD to perform the relay attack entirely without credentials. Any connection over HTTP to a host that is considered part of the Intranet Zone by Windows can be used in an identical matter (provided automatic intranet detection is enabled). Eladâ€™s original blog described using WebDAV to exploit this on hosts. Another attack avenue is (again) <a href="https://dirkjanm.io/abusing-exchange-one-api-call-away-from-domain-admin/">PrivExchange</a>, which makes Exchange authenticate as SYSTEM unless the latest patches are installed.<br/>
