SeEnableDelegationPrivilege <br/>
One user right I overlooked, until <a href="https://twitter.com/meatballs__">Ben Campbell’s</a>&nbsp;post on <a href="https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/trust-years-to-earn-seconds-to-break/">constrained delegation</a>, was <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349804(v=ws.10).aspx#BKMK_22">SeEnableDelegationPrivilege</a>. This right governs whether a user account can “<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349804(v=ws.10).aspx#BKMK_22">Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation</a>.” Part of the reason I overlooked it is stated right in the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349804(v=ws.10).aspx#BKMK_22">documentation</a>: “<i>There is no reason to assign this user right to anyone on member servers and workstations that belong to a domain because it has no meaning in those contexts; it is only relevant on domain controllers and stand-alone computers.</i>” So this right applies to the domain, not the local domain-joined machine.<br/>

<a href="https://twitter.com/meatballs__">Ben</a>&nbsp;explained how <b>SeEnableDelegationPrivilege</b>&nbsp;factors into <a href="https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/trust-years-to-earn-seconds-to-break/">constrained delegation</a>. This was a missing piece of the whole puzzle for me. We both first thought that this right <i>only</i>&nbsp;governed the modification of the TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION and TRUSTED_TO_AUTHENTICATE_FOR_DELEGATION flags- this would have opened up a nifty attack that Ben outlined. Unfortunately for us attackers, it appears that this right also controls the modification of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc220234.aspx">msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo</a>&nbsp;property, which contains the targets for constrained delegation. If this is unclear, check out the <a href="http://www.harmj0y.net/blog/activedirectory/s4u2pwnage/">post from last week</a>&nbsp;for more background on constrained delegation.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>TL;DR</b>&nbsp;we can’t modify delegation specific user account control settings NOR the <b>msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo</b>&nbsp;field for targets (even if we have full control of the object) if we don’t have the <b>SeEnableDelegationPrivilege</b>&nbsp;right:<br/>
