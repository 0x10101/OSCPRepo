<title>Malicious MSI</title>

Changes you need to make!<ul><li>At minimum, the Property line needs to be changed to the command you want to execute</li>
<li>&lt;File Id="ApplicationFile1" Source="example.exe"/&gt; also needs to be changed (example.exe doesn't exist) or removed in order to build the msi </li>
</ul>
<br/>
It turns out that a benefit of launching your code via an MSI are the SYSTEM privileges that you gain during the install process. To understand how this works, we need to look atÂ <a href="http://wixtoolset.org/">WIX Toolset</a>, which is an open source project used to create MSI files from XML build scripts.<br/>
<br/>
The WIX Framework is made up of several tools, but the two that we will focus on are:<br/>
<br/>
candle.exe - Takes a .WIX XML file and outputs a .WIXOBJ<br/>
light.exe - Takes a .WIXOBJ and creates a .MSI<br/>
<br/>
Reviewing the documentation for WIX, we see that custom actions are provided, which give the developer a way to launch scripts and processes during the install process. Within the CustomAction documentation, we see something interesting:<br/>
<img src="image.png" /><br/>
<br/>
This documents a simple way in which a MSI can be used to launch processes as SYSTEM, by providing a custom action with an Impersonate attribute set to false.<br/>
<br/>
When crafted, our WIX file will look like this: (see child page Custom WiX File)<br/>
<br/>
A lot of this is just boilerplate to generate a MSI, however <b>the parts to note are our custom actions</b>:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Property Id="cmdline"&gt;powershell...&lt;/Property&gt;<br/>
&lt;CustomAction Id="SystemShell" Execute="deferred" Directory="TARGETDIR" ExeCommand='[cmdline]' Return="ignore" Impersonate="no"/&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This <b>custom action is responsible for executing our provided cmdline as SYSTEM</b>&nbsp;(note the Property tag, which is a nice way to get around the length limitation of the ExeCommand attribute for long Powershell commands).<br/>
<br/>
Another trick which is useful is to ensure that the install fails after our command is executed, which will stop the installer from adding a new entry to "Add or Remove Programs" which is shown here by executing invalid VBScript:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;CustomAction Id="FailInstall" Execute="deferred" Script="vbscript" Return="check"&gt;<br/>
&nbsp; invalid vbs to fail install<br/>
&lt;/CustomAction&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we have our InstallExecuteSequence tag, which is responsible for executing our custom actions in order:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;InstallExecuteSequence&gt;<br/>
&nbsp; &lt;Custom Action="SystemShell" After="InstallInitialize"&gt;&lt;/Custom&gt;<br/>
&nbsp; &lt;Custom Action="FailInstall" Before="InstallFiles"&gt;&lt;/Custom&gt;<br/>
&lt;/InstallExecuteSequence&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, when executed:<br/>
<br/>
Our first custom action will be launched, forcing our payload to run as the SYSTEM account.<br/>
Our second custom action will be launched, causing some invalid VBScript to be executed and stop the install process with an error.<br/>
<br/>
To compile this into a MSI we save the above contents as a file called "msigen.wix", and use the following commands:<br/>
<br/>
candle.exe msigen.wix<br/>
light.exe msigen.wixobj<br/>
<br/>
Finally, execute the MSI file to execute our payload as SYSTEM.</body></html>
