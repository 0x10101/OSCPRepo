<title>Attacking IEEE 802.1 X</title>
</head><body><b>Pre-Authentication Traffic, Attacking RADIUS</b><br/>
Before access to the rest of the network, the client is allowed to communicate with the RADIUS server for authentication regarding the supported EAP type. <br/>
RADIUS servers have demonstrated a history of security vulnerabilities in handling malformed EAP traffic. The switch's only responsiblity is to forward EAP payload to the server encapsulated in a RADIUS Tyle/Length/Value (TLV) field. <br/>
<br/>
<b>EAPMD5 Fuzzing</b><br/>
If the RADIUS server stops returning RADIUS traffic back to the client, the attacker knows the RADIUS server has stopped responding. This can be dangerous causing DoS in a client environment, so maybe ask to fuzz the server in a non-production environment in-case of a crash.<br/>
[eapmd5fuzzies.py](https://www.willhackforsushi.com/code/eapmd5fuzzies.py) | developed as a 'kick-start' to custom eapmd5 fuzzing<br/>
<br/>
<b>EAP Shadow Attack</b><br/>
With a legitimate client, an attacker can "shadow" a device post-authentication by impersonating the MAC of a victim. 802.1X is a layer2 protocol, so the switch doesn't care about the IP address, only the MAC.<br/>
[PWN Plug] | Commercial plug-and-hack tool from Pwnie Express. Will bridgfe all traffic between two devices and watch for downstream HTTP activity. It will automatically copy a victim's MAC and IP and create an SSH tunnel for the attacker. <br/>
<br/>
<b>VLAN Manipulation</b><br/>
Windows do not natively support VLAN trunking features (such as IEEE 802.1Q). Windows will identify and drop tagged frames upon receipt instead of passing to the OS. <br/>
Virtual machine guests are unable to observe trunk packets and unable to participate in or exploit VLANs as well. <br/>
<br/>
Use a native Linux OS system when working with VLANs as much as possible. <br/>
