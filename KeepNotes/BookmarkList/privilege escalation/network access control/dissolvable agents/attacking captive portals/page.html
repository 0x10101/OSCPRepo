<title>Attacking Captive Portals</title>
</head><body>There are several attack opportunities:<ul><li>Captive portal itself</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Web server (typical web attacks)</li>
<li>SNMP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pre-authentication services</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>DHCP</li>
<li>DNS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pre-authentication client devices</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>May be able to contact other client devices without authentication</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Sniffing</b><br/>
Some internal captive portal servers may not use SSL for credential protection, allowing them to be sniffed on the network with Cain for instance. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Bypass with Impersonation<br/>
</b><b>MAC/IP</b><br/>
Some inline captive portal systems will base validation on MAC/IP, which an attacker can impersonate. There is an issue with live clients on the network. Impersonating an active user on the network will cause IP conflicts and unstable connections for you and the client. <br/>
The solution is to ultimately impersonate an inactive user, which will need to be identified.<br/>
<br/>
[cpscam](http://www.willhackforsushi.com/code/cpscam.pl) may also need the NetPacket module:<br/>
# perl -MCPAN -e 'install NetPacket::IP'<br/>
Captive Portal Scam provides this functionality. It will observe network traffic to build a list of client IP and MAC addresses. Once a client is determined to be inactive, cpscam will notify.<br/>
<br/>
[Pickupline]<br/>
Pickupline collects a list of IPs and MAC addresses, but doesn't maintain the list as well as cpscam does. <br/>
<br/>
<b>OUI Whitelist</b><br/>
Some devices may be excluded from authentication checks. These may include phones, iPads, handhelpds, other PDAs which are not supported by the particular NAC vendor. <br/>
It's not as easy as spoofing a MAC/IP from the OUI whitelist anymore since many NAC force additional checks. As an attacker, more work is required to complete impersonation. <br/>
Some linux distributions have a list of OUIs at /usr/local/share/oui.txt<br/>
<br/>
System Validation<br/>
A few additional checks that may need to be bypassed include:<ul><li>Browser-Agents</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>HTTP Header</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passive OS Fingerprinting</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Passively observice traffic, (TTLs, Window Size, frame size, status of DF flag, max segment size, window scale, Timestamp, ACK flag, order of TCP flags, and more.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Nmap and [p0f] do passive fingerprinting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JavaScript OS Validation</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>DOM fingerprinting information (Platform, Vendor, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Solution: Complete Obfuscation (from IP layer up)<br/>
Word of caution: Now your tools. Spoofing networking stack can have issues with Virtual machines/network adapters and software. Test locally to ensure you know the bounds of your tool.<br/>
[OSfuscate](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/code) | simple list of Windows INI formated profile descriptor files to describe several characteristics of a target TCP/IP stack including ttl, stamp, pmtu, urg, window, sack, mtu<br/>
[Scapy] plus iptables<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;iptables is needed to prevent the OS from sending a RST packet while scapy starts the initial SYN<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 --tcp-flags RST RST -s &lt;source&gt; -d &lt;captive_portal&gt; -j DROP<br/>
<br/>
<b>Javascript OS Validation</b><br/>
Typically JS queries DOM fields for validation. Some browser User Agent Switchers will also update fields in the DOM. Some common fields are:<ul><li>navigator.buildID - Used to disclose build number for the browser, not used by Apple's Safari on the iPad</li>
<li>navigator.oscpu - Ued to disclose the CPU type used on the host, not used by Apple's Safari on the iPad</li>
<li>navigator.product - Used to disclose the product name (like "Gecko")</li>
<li>navigator.productSub - Used to disclose a sub-name to the product field, set to "20030107" on Apple's Safari on the iPad</li>
</ul>
<br/>
To bypass systems using JS OS Validation, we need to manipulate the responses from these fields as well.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Custom Browser Impersonation</b><br/>
Firefox allows us to customize values that are returned from the DOM through JS configuration keys in the format general.XXX.override where XXX is all-lowercase name of the DOM suffix after "navigator"<ul><li>go to about:config</li>
<li>Right-click and add a new String</li>
<li>Enter "general.XXX.override" (eg to override navigator.oscpu create general.oscpu.override)</li>
<li>Enter value for the key to match your impersonation (eg for iPad, since Safari doesn't use this, configure string with value "undefined")</li>
</ul>
