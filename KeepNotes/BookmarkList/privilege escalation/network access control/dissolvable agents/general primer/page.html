<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>Typically implemented when a company wants to enforce a simple authentication and check clients meet minimum security requirements. A dissolvable agent will be downloaded and run on a computer and will remove itself after checks are complete. If checks are passed, access is granted to the network. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Auth</b><br/>
Clientless NAC systems often leverage a captive portal authentication system to validate a user's identity. Once authenticated, the server will grant access to the network. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Validation</b><br/>
ActiveX, Java, or other browser control can launch and perform the system validation. <br/>
Captive portals can use a variety of ways to identify and fingerprint the client including MAC address, IP address, User-Agents, a combination of techniques, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Post-Auth</b><br/>
If the server is using out-of-band management, it may use SNMP or an interactive session to grant the end-user access to a second VLAN that has interactive access. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Captive Portals</b><br/>
Lightweight NAC systems use weak authentication controls. Mobile devices often obtain a policy exception due to platform limitations (no Java/Flash, lack of management, etc). <br/>
These exceptions in Lightweight NACs create opportunities for bypass/exploitation.<br/>

Switch access ports are "closed" until successful authentication<br/>
Three components are generally required:<ul><li>Supplicant or client software</li>
<li>The Port Access Entity (PAE)</li>
<li>Authentication server (backend RADIUS server)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
In wired NAC environments, simple EAP methods are more common. Weak password-based authentication such as EAP-MD5 may be used with certificate-based authentication using EAP/TLS is becoming more popular<br/>
