<title>Pre-Requisites</title>
</head><body><br/>
<b>Pre-requisites:</b><ul><li>&nbsp;A solid understanding of TCP and UDP networking protocols, and know how to read through a packet capture.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Be familiar with different services: DNS, SNMP, SMTP, SMB, HTTP, and FTP (among others). Be able to read through packet captures most of those services.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Be comfortable with scripting and get your hands dirty with Python and Shell scripting it will help you a lot..</li>
<li>&nbsp;Be comfortable with Linux and Windows command line syntax and tools.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Be familiar with Assembly and a debugger.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Be prepared to work around 20 hours a week on this, this can be challenging to do next to a fulltime job.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Web Application Programming experience should be really helpful, as you can grasp it quickly.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Self Learning is very important.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Database knowledge is Advantage, You may get situations where it will be necessary.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Be prepared to Try Harder, this course isn’t a SANS or CEH course where you just fill in a multiple choice exam.</li>
<li>&nbsp;There is a reason few people pass the exam from the first time.It’s very important that you take good notes and supporting screenshots while hitting the lab. I like KeepNote, which was recommended by Offensive Security during the course. I also installed shutter on my machine to take screenshots. It’s similar to the snipping tool in Windows.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Take a good backup. I accidently removed part of my notes. The easiest way in my opinion is to use a git repo and regularly push and commit your notes/binaries/scripts or whatever you made to your repo (I used Ubuntu cloud one to sync). It’s easier to track what you have been doing and lowers the risk of deleting things by accident.</li>
</ul>
