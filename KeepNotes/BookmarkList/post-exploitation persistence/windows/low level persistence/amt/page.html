[DeathMetal](https://github.com/Coalfire-Research/DeathMetal) | https://www.coalfire.com/The-Coalfire-Blog/April-2019/The-Death-Metal-Suite, Red team &amp; penetration testing tools to exploit the capabilities of Intel AMT &nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
According to Wikipedia, "Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) is hardware and firmware technology for remote out-of-band management of personal computers, in order to monitor, maintain, update, upgrade, and repair them". You can ask, what could possible go wrong? See <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/bh09usa/Ring%20-3%20Rootkits.pdf">Alexander Tereshkin's and Rafal Wojtczuk's great research on this</a>, or <a href="http://people.kth.se/~maguire/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/100402-Vassilios_Ververis-with-cover.pdf">Vassilios Ververis thesis about AMT</a>. <br/>
<br/>
As not many people click on links, let me quote the scary stuff about AMT:<ul><li>Independent of main CPU</li>
<li>Can access host memory via DMA (with restrictions)</li>
<li>Dedicated link to NIC, and its filtering capabilities</li>
<li>Can force host OS to reboot at any time (and boot the system from the emulated CDROM)</li>
<li>Active even in S3 sleep!</li>
</ul>
<br/>
From Coalfire:<br/>
Instead of operating at a software level, Death Metal operates from a hardware level. With the Death Metal suite, we are essentially misusing and abusing mainstream commercial functionality in unexpected ways. Within the information security community, attacks against AMT itself are not news; however, Death Metal will introduce new ways to begin attacking the AMT framework in a practical, red-team fashion. &nbsp;<br/>

<b>Advice for the Blue Team</b><br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The best advice I have at reducing the risks inherent to AMT is to buy systems without it enabled. If that is not possible, provision your systems before someone malicious does, change the password, and disable everything you can. Pressing ctrl+p during system boot is the most common way of entering the MEBX (Management Engine Bios Extension) menu system, which exposes the configuration options. The default password is <b>admin</b>. It really pains me to say this, because it reduces office pranking potential â€“ but if someone has beaten you to it, popping out the little coin-cell battery clears the password (on Dell laptops at least).<br/>

Try this out on FedRAMP engagements including an assessment of golden laptop configurations.<br/>

This has been a fun project so far, and there is so much more to be done. Did you know it can speak WiFi and IPv6?<br/>
